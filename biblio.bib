  abstract =    {The ability of several water models to predict the properties of ices
is discussed. The emphasis is put on the results for the densities
and the coexistence curves between the different ice forms. It is
concluded that none of the most commonly used rigid models is satisfactory.
A new model specifically designed to cope with solid-phase properties
is proposed. The parameters have been obtained by fitting the equation
of state and selected points of the melting lines and of the coexistence
lines involving different ice forms. The phase diagram is then calculated
for the new potential. The predicted melting temperature of hexagonal
ice (Ih) at 1 bar is 272.2 K. This excellent value does not imply
a deterioration of the rest of the properties. In fact, the predictions
for both the densities and the coexistence curves are better than
for TIP4P, which previously yielded the best estimations of the ice
properties.},

which consists of three fixed point charges and one Lennard-Jones
center. The parametrization has been based on a fit of the temperature
of maximum density (indirectly estimated from the melting point of
hexagonal ice), the stability of several ice polymorphs and other
commonly used target quantities. The calculated properties include
a variety of thermodynamic properties of the liquid and solid phases,
the phase diagram involving condensed phases, properties at melting
and vaporization, dielectric constant, pair distribution function,
and self-diffusion coefficient. These properties cover a temperature
range from 123 to 573 K and pressures up to 40,000 bar. The model
gives an impressive performance for this variety of properties and
thermodynamic conditions. For example, it gives excellent predictions
for the densities at 1 bar with a maximum density at 278 K and an
averaged difference with experiment of 7 x 10(-4) g/cm3.},

  abstract =       {Computationally-guided material discovery is being increasingly employed using a descriptor-based screening through the calculation of a few properties of interest. A precise understanding of the uncertainty associated with first principles density functional theory calculated property values is important for the success of descriptor-based screening. Bayesian error estimation approach has been built-in to several recently developed exchange-correlation functionals, which allows an estimate of the uncertainty associated with properties related to the ground state energy, for e.g. adsorption energies. Here, we propose a robust and computationally efficient method for quantifying uncertainty in mechanical properties, which depends on the derivatives of the energy. The procedure involves calculating the energy around the equilibrium cell volume with different strains and fitting the obtained energies to the corresponding energy-strain relationship. At each strain, we use instead of a single energy, an ensemble of energies, giving us an ensemble of fits and thereby, an ensemble of mechanical properties associated with each fit, whose spread can be used to quantify its uncertainty. The generation of ensemble of energies is only a post-processing step involving a perturbation of parameters of the exchange-correlation functional and solving for the energy non-self consistently. The proposed method is computationally efficient and provides a more robust uncertainty estimate compared to the approach of self-consistent calculations employing several different exchange-correlation functionals. We demonstrate the method by calculating the uncertainty bounds for Si using the developed method. We show that the calculated uncertainty bounds the property values obtained using three different GGA functionals: PBE, PBEsol and RPBE.},

  abstract =       {Judging the significance and reproducibility of quantitative research requires a good understanding of relevant uncertainties, but it is often unclear how well these have been evaluated and what they imply. Reported scientific uncertainties were studied by analysing 41000 measurements of 3200 quantities from medicine, nuclear and particle physics, and interlaboratory comparisons ranging from chemistry to toxicology. Outliers are common, with 5{\sigma} disagreements up to five orders of magnitude more frequent than naively expected. Uncertainty-normalized differences between multiple measurements of the same quantity are consistent with heavy-tailed Student-t distributions that are often almost Cauchy, far from a Gaussian Normal bell curve. Medical research uncertainties are generally as well evaluated as those in physics, but physics uncertainty improves more rapidly, making feasible simple significance criteria such as the 5{\sigma} discovery convention in particle physics. Contributions to measurement uncertainty from mistakes and unknown problems are not completely unpredictable. Such errors appear to have power-law distributions consistent with how designed complex systems fail, and how unknown systematic errors are constrained by researchers. This better understanding may help improve analysis and meta-analysis of data, and help scientists and the public have more realistic expectations of what scientific results imply.},

  Abstract                 = {Coexistence curves of water in cylindrical and slitlike nanopores of different size and water-substrate interaction strength were simulated in the Gibbs ensemble. The two-phase coexistence regions cover a wide range of pore filling level and temperature, including ambient temperature. Five different kinds of two-phase coexistence are observed. A single liquid-vapor coexistence is observed in hydrophobic and moderately hydrophilic pores. Surface transitions split from the main liquid-vapor coexistence region, when the water-substrate interaction becomes comparable or stronger than the water-water pair interaction. In this case prewetting, one and two layering transitions were observed. The critical temperature of the first layering transition decreases with strengthening water-substrate interaction towards the critical temperature expected for two-dimensional systems and is not sensitive to the variation of pore size and shape. Liquid-vapor phase transition in a pore with a wall which is already covered with two water layers is most typical for hydrophilic pores. The critical temperature of this transition is very sensitive to the pore size, in contrast to the liquid-vapor critical temperature in hydrophobic pores. The observed rich phase behavior of water in pores evidences that the knowledge of coexistence curves is of crucial importance for the analysis of experimental results and a prerequiste of meaningful simulations.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper surveys issues associated with the statistical calibration of physics-based computer simulators. Even in solidly physics-based models there are usually a number of parameters that are suitable targets for calibration. Statistical calibration means refining the prior distributions of such uncertain parameters based on matching some simulation outputs with data, as opposed to the practice of "tuning" or point estimation that is commonly called calibration in non-statistical contexts. Older methods for statistical calibration are reviewed before turning to recent work in which the calibration problem is embedded in a Gaussian process model. In procedures of this type, parameter estimation is carried out simultaneously with the estimation of the relationship between the calibrated simulator and truth.},

  abstract =  {In 1991 Morris proposed an effective screening sensitivity measure
to identify the few important factors in models with many factors.
The method is based on computing for each input a number of incremental
ratios, namely elementary effects, which are then averaged to assess
the overall importance of the input. Despite its value, the method
is still rarely used and instead local analyses varying one factor
at a time around a baseline point are usually employed. In this piece
of work we propose a revised version of the elementary effects method,
improved in terms of both the definition of the measure and the sampling
strategy. In the present form the method shares many of the positive
qualities of the variance-based techniques, having the advantage
of a lower computational cost, as demonstrated by the analytical
examples. The method is employed to assess the sensitivity of a chemical
reaction model for dimethylsulphide (DMS), a gas involved in climate
change. Results of the sensitivity analysis open up the ground for
model reconsideration: some model components may need a more thorough
modelling effort while some others may need to be simplified. (c)

  Abstract                 = {We propose Lennard-Jones potential parameters for interatomic interactions of linear and branched alkanes based on matching the results of Gibbs ensemble simulations of vapor-liquid equilibria to experimental data. The alkane model is similar as in the OPLS-AA, but multiple atom types for carbon based on the number of covalently bonded hydrogen atoms are necessary to accurately reproduce liquid densities and enthalpies of vaporization with the errors of 2.1\% and 3.3\%, respectively, for hydrocarbons of various chain lengths and structures. We find that the attraction energies of the carbon atoms are almost proportional to the number of covalent hydrogen atoms with each increasing the carbon energy parameter by approximately 0.033 kcal/mol. Though the present force field outperforms the OPLS-AA force field for alkanes we studied, systematic deviations for vapor pressures are still observed with errors of 15\%-30\%, and critical temperatures are slightly underestimated. We think that these shortcomings are probably due to the inadequacy of the two-parameter Lennard-Jones potential, and especially its behavior at short distances.},

  Abstract                 = {A Monte Carlo simulation method is presented for simulation of phase transitions, with emphasis on the study of crystallization. The method relies on a random walk in order parameter Phi(q(N)) space to calculate a free energy profile between the two coexisting phases. The energy and volume data generated over the course of the simulation are subsequently reweighed to identify the precise conditions for phase coexistence. The usefulness of the method is demonstrated in the context of crystallization of a purely repulsive Lennard-Jones system. A systematic analysis of precritical and critical nuclei as a function of supercooling reveals a gradual change from a bcc to a fcc structure inside the crystalline nucleus as it grows at large degrees of supercooling. The method is generally applicable and is expected to find applications in systems for which two or more coexisting phases can be distinguished through one or more order parameters.},

Typically, the approaches make use of quoted combined uncertainties. We propose an approach which is based on more detailed uncertainty information. We assume that each of the participating laboratories has knowledge about the precision of its measurements and, in addition, provides a probability density function ( PDF) which encodes its assessment on the size of its bias. Only the case of a single stable travelling standard is considered. The analysis starts with a consistency test of the data and the PDFs provided by the participating laboratories. If this test is passed, a probabilistic approach based on a bias model is applied in order to merge the information of all participants. PDFs for the value of the travelling standard and, in particular, for the biases of the participating laboratories are derived. Explicit results are given for Gaussian PDFs. It is shown that the proposed use of detailed uncertainty information results in improved estimates of the biases. In particular for those laboratories expecting to have a large bias, the uncertainty about their biases can thereby be reduced significantly. },

  Abstract                 = {Because the connection factors between theoretical and experimental results of thermodynamic quantities are given through the molecular interaction parameters, for chemical engineering applications it is necessary to use exact values of these parameters for a determined molecular interaction model. Because the results of computer simulation may be considered 'exact' for a determined intermolecular potential, it makes an excellent tool for investigating this connection. The purpose of the present work is to propose a procedure for determining interaction parameters for fluids by forcing agreement between the values of pressure obtained from empirical Equations of state in phase space regions where we are sure they are most exact and those obtained from computer simulation.},

  Abstract                 = {Offsets due to systematic calibration errors are a common feature of the literature on temperature-dependent rate constants. We present a formalism for dealing with these offsets within the context of least-squares fitting, using a priori parameter constraints based on the estimated accuracy of individual studies. This methodology not only eliminates biases caused by calibration errors, it also ensures that the metric used to compare different studies is their accuracy, not their precision. Consequently, studies with single measurements at room temperature can be meaningfully compared with studies comprising dozens of measurements spanning a wide temperature range. We apply this procedure to the complete literature dataset for two reactions: OH + propane and OH + n-butane, after first presenting new data for OH + n-butane spanning the temperature range 180-300 K and extending the low-temperature limit of the literature by 50 K. There is outstanding agreement among a very large set of studies, including relative measurements of the propane: n-butane rate constant ratio. We present new reduced transition state theory fits for each reaction that accurately reproduce the observed rate constants between 180 and 1000 K, and argue that these two reactions are the optimal reference reactions for many relative rate studies.

  Abstract                 = {This paper reviews practices in the expression of uncertainty in the experimental literature for thermodynamic property measurements with determinations of critical temperature for pure compounds used as a case study. The time period considered is from 1940 to the present, with an emphasis on results published since 1990. One hundred ninety-four articles were considered involving hundreds of compounds. The goals of this paper are to show how the nature and extent of estimations of uncertainty have changed in this time period and to document the extent to which the information provided in the articles corresponds to the recommendations of the GUM. (The GUM is the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement published in 1993 by the International Organization for Standardization, ISO. This document describes current recommended practices in this area.) It is shown that although gradual and continuous progress has been made in the reporting of uncertainty information, comprehensive uncertainty analyses remain rare, particularly with regard to the consideration of contributions arising from sample impurities. Problems in the application of experimental property results to technological challenges are discussed within the broad context of inconsistencies in the expression of uncertainty. Widespread acceptance and application of the standard methods and terminologies established within the GUM are encouraged for the benefit of experimentalists, data evaluators, and data users alike. },

Phase coexistence conditions are determined through manipulation of a total density probability distribution evaluated over a density range that includes both coexisting phases. Saturation quantities are determined through appropriate averaging of density-dependent mean values of a given property of interest. We discuss how to implement the method in both the grand-canonical and isothermal-isobaric semigrand ensembles. Calculations can be conducted using any of the recently introduced flat-histogram techniques. Here, we combine the general algorithm with a transition-matrix approach to produce an efficient self-adaptive technique for determining multicomponent phase equilibrium properties. To assess the performance of the new method, we generate phase diagrams for a number of binary and ternary Lennard-Jones mixtures.},

The fluids were modeled by spherical Lennard-Jones pair-potentials with parameters adjusted to experimental vapor liquid-equilibria data alone. Good agreement between the predictions from simulation and experimental data is found for shear viscosity and thermal conductivity of the pure fluids and binary mixtures. The simulation results for the bulk viscosity show only poor agreement with experimental data for most fluids, despite good agreement with other simulation data from the literature. This indicates that presently available experimental data for the bulk viscosity, a property which is difficult to measure, are inaccurate. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {A new force field has been developed for alcohol and polyalcohol molecules. Based on the anisotropic united-atom force field AUA4 developed for hydrocarbons, it only introduces one new anisotropic united atom corresponding to the hydroxyl group OH. In the case of polyalcohols and complex molecules, the calculation of the intramolecular electrostatic energy is revisited. These interactions are calculated between charges belonging to the different local dipoles of the molecule, one dipole being defined as a group of consecutive charges globally neutral. This new method allows avoiding the use of empirical scaling parameters commonly introduced to calculate 1-4 electrostatic interactions. The transferability of the proposed potential is demonstrated through the simulation of a wide variety of alcohol families: primary alcohols (methanol, ethanol, propan-1-ol, hexan-1-ol, octan-1-ol), secondary alcohols (propan-2-ol), tertiary alcohols (2-methylpropan-2-ol), phenol, and diols (1,2-ethanediol, 1,3-propanediol, 1,5-pentanediol). Monte Carlo simulations carried out in the Gibbs ensemble lead to a good agreement between calculated and experimental data for the thermodynamic properties along the liquid/vapor saturation curve, for the critical point coordinates and for the liquid structure at room temperature. Additional simulations were performed on the methanol + n-butane system showing the capability of the proposed potential to reproduce the azeotropic behavior of such mixtures with a good agreement.},

On the other hand, there is ample evidence in nuclear physics of significant disagreements among measurements, which are inconsistent with the normal distribution, given their stated uncertainties. In this study the histories of 99 measurements of the lifetimes of five elementary particles are examined to determine what can be inferred about the distribution of their values relative to their stated uncertainties. Taken as a whole, the variations in die data are somewhat larger than their quoted uncertainties would indicate. These data strongly support using a Student t distribution for the likelihood function instead of a normal. The most probable value for the order of the t distribution is 2.6 +/- 0.9. It is shown that analyses based on long-tailed t-distribution likelihoods gracefully cope with outlying data.},

In this way, they enable one to establish comprehensive boundary conditions for a safety system in terms of unavailability, the quantities of the undesired by-product (TCDD) produced and the times available before a required intervention, if a pre-determined quantity of TCDD is tolerated. It is shown that accounting for stochastic effects and uncertainties derived from insufficient knowledge provides a broader and more realistic knowledge base for devising a viable safety concept.},

  Abstract                 = {The lack of plant-specific reliability data for probabilistic safety assessments usually makes it necessary to use generic reliability data. Justifiably different assessments of plant behaviour (success criteria) lead to different models of plant systems. Both affect the numerical results of a probabilistic safety assessment. It is shown how these results change, if different sets of reliability data and different choices of success criteria for the safety system are employed. Differences in results may influence decisions taken on their basis and become especially important if compliance with a safety goal has to be proved, e.g. a safety integrity level. For the purpose of demonstration an accident sequence from a probabilistic safety assessment of a plant producing nitroglycol is used. The analysis relies on plant-specific reliability data so that it provides a good yardstick for comparing it with results obtained using generic data. The superiority of plant-specific data, which should of course be acquired, cannot be doubted. Nevertheless, plant safety can be improved even if generic data are used. However, the assignment to a safety integrity level may be affected by differences in both data and success criteria.},

  abstract =    {The multivariate chemometric techniques two level factorial design
(TLFD) and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to investigate
the TIP4P model potential behavior with respect to perturbations
on all intermolecular interaction parameters. The effects of these
perturbations were calculated for the enthalpy of vaporization, the
density, the first maximum of the radial distribution functions of
the O-H and O-O pairs, and the second maximum of the radial distribution
function of the O-H pair obtained from Monte Carlo simulations of
liquid water at 25 degrees C. The principal effects were quantified
and rationalized in terms of the pair-wise interaction potential
of the TIP4P model. They also corroborate previously published sensitivity
analysis results using molecular dynamics and other model potentials.
In addition, significant interaction effects between some parameters
of the TIP4P model potential were observed and quantified, which
hardly could be obtained without such a statistic approach. These
interaction effects are very regular and systematic, and their behavior
has not been encountered in other chemometric studies and cannot
be rationalized in terms of the functional form of the pair-wise
potential.},

  Abstract                 = {Classical force fields for molecular simulations of aqueous electrolytes are still controversial. We study alkali and halide ions at the air/water interface using novel non-polarizable force fields that were optimized based on bulk thermodynamics. In qualitative agreement with polarizable force-field simulations, ion repulsion from the interface decreases with increasing ion size. Iodide is even enhanced at the interface, which is rationalized by hydrophobic solvation at the interface, but exhibits a smaller surface propensity than in previous polarizable simulations. Surprisingly, lithium is less repelled than other cations because of its tightly bound hydration shell. A generalized Poisson-Boltzmann approach that includes ionic potentials of mean force from simulation almost quantitatively matches experimental interfacial tension increments for 1 molar sodium halides and alkali chlorides. We conclude that properly optimized non-polarizable force fields are transferable to interfacial environments and hold the potential for unravelling non-specific effects even in biological situations involving peptidic surfaces.

are in very good agreement with x-ray scattering intensities at temperatures
between 0 and 77 degrees C and dynamical properties such as self-diffusion

are often too time expensive to be directly used to perform uncertainty,
sensitivity, optimization and robustness analyses. A widely accepted
method to circumvent this problem consists in replacing cpu time
expensive computer models by cpu inexpensive mathematical functions,
called metamodels. In this paper, we focus on the Gaussian process
metamodel and two essential steps of its definition phase. First,
the initial design of the computer code input variables (which allows
to fit the metamodel) has to honor adequate space filling properties.
We adopt a numerical approach to compare the performance of different
types of space filling designs, in the class of the optimal Latin
hypercube samples, in terms of the predictivity of the subsequent
fitted metamodel. We conclude that such samples with minimal wrap-around
discrepancy are particularly well-suited for the Gaussian process
metamodel fitting. Second, the metamodel validation process consists
in evaluating the metamodel predictivity with respect to the initial
computer code. We propose and test an algorithm which optimizes the
distance between the validation points and the metamodel learning
points in order to estimate the true metamodel predictivity with
a minimum number of validation points. Comparisons with classical
validation algorithms and application to a nuclear safety computer
code show the relevance of this new sequential validation design.},

  Abstract                 = {We review the existing simulation data and equations of state for the Lennard-Jones (LJ) fluid, and present new simulation results for both the cut and shifted and the full LJ potential. New parameters for the modified Benedict-Webb-Rubin (MBWR) equation of state used by Nicolas, Gubbins, Streett and Tildesley arc presented. In contrast to previous equations, the new equation is accurate for calculations of vapour-liquid equilibria. The equation also accurately correlates pressures and internal energies from the triple point to about 4.5 times the critical temperature over the entire fluid range. An equation of state for the cut and shifted LJ fluid is presented and compared with the simulation data of this work, and previously published Gibbs ensemble data. The MBWR equation of state can be extended to mixtures via the van der Waals one-fluid theory mixing rules. Calculations for binary fluid mixtures are found to be accurate when compared with Gibbs ensemble simulations.},

  abstract =  {In many engineering optimization problems, the number of function
evaluations is severely limited by time or cost. These problems pose
a special challenge to the field of global optimization, since existing
methods often require more function evaluations than can be comfortably
afforded. One way to address this challenge is to fit response surfaces
to data collected by evaluating the objective and constraint functions
at a few points. These surfaces can then be used for visualization,
tradeoff analysis, and optimization. In this paper, we introduce
the reader to a response surface methodology that is especially good
at modeling the nonlinear, multimodal functions that often occur
in engineering. We then show how these approximating functions can
be used to construct an efficient global optimization algorithm with
a credible stopping rule. The key to using response surfaces for
global optimization Lies in balancing the need to exploit the approximating
surface (by sampling where it is minimized) with the need to improve
the approximation (by sampling where prediction error may be high).
Striking this balance requires solving certain auxiliary problems
which have previously been considered intractable, but we show how
these computational obstacles can be overcome.},

  Abstract                 = {Stochastic effects and data uncertainties are present in any engineering calculation. Their impact may be particularly important if they concern the design of process equipment. A calculation model for the dynamic behavior of a heat exchanger and procedures to deal with the related uncertainties are presented. Their propagation through the calculation by means of a Monte Carlo approach is shown. The temperature at the heat exchanger outlet and the step response of a sudden variation in the heat exchanger inlet temperature are simulated and evaluated by way of example. It is demonstrated that the inclusion of stochastic effects and uncertainties provides a more reliable basis for design decisions and hence reduces the probability of errors.},

  Abstract                 = {We perform molecular dynamics simulations of 512 waterlike molecules that interact via the TIP5P potential and are confined between two smooth hydrophobic plates that are separated by 1.10 nm. We find that the anomalous thermodynamic properties of water are shifted to lower temperatures relative to the bulk by approximately 40 K. The dynamics and structure of the confined water resemble bulk water at higher temperatures, consistent with the shift of thermodynamic anomalies to lower temperature. Because of this T shift, our confined water simulations (down to T=220 K) do not reach sufficiently low temperature to observe a liquid-liquid phase transition found for bulk water at T approximately 215 K using the TIP5P potential, but we see inflections in isotherms at lower temperatures presumably due to the presence of a liquid-liquid critical point. We find that the different crystalline structures that can form for two different separations of the plates, 0.7 and 1.10 nm, have no counterparts in the bulk system, and we discuss the relevance to experiments on confined water.},

A direct approach to determining the spatial structure in the liquid
state is demonstrated here. Three-dimensional maps representing the
local atomic densities are presented for several water models. These
spatial maps provide a picture of the short-range order in liquid
water which reveals specific details of its local structure that

The intrusion, which takes place above the bulk saturation pressure, can be well described using a macroscopic capillary model. Once the material is saturated with water, extrusion takes place upon reduction of the externally applied pressure. Our results for the extrusion pressure can only be understood by assuming that the limiting extrusion mechanism is the nucleation of a vapor bubble inside the pores. A comparison of calculated and experimental nucleation pressures shows that a proper inclusion of line tension effects is necessary to account for the observed values of nucleation barriers. Negative line tensions of order 10(-11) J m(-1) are found for our system, in reasonable agreement with other experimental estimates of this quantity.},

  Abstract                 = {We report a series of Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations of water adsorption in NaY and NaX faujasite, as well as in silicalite-1. Computed adsorption isotherms and heats of adsorption were in good agreement with the available experiments. The existence of cyclic water hexamers in NaX located in the 12-ring windows, recently disclosed by neutron diffraction experiments (Hunger et al., J. Phys. Chem. B, 2006, 110, 342-353) was reproduced in our simulations. Interestingly enough, such cyclic hexamer clusters were also observed in the case of NaY, in which no stabilizing cation is present in the 12-ring window. We also report cation redistribution upon water adsorption for sodium faujasite with varying cation contents (Si ratio Al ratio in the range 1.53-3). A simple and transferable forcefield was used, that enabled to reproduce the different aspects of water physisorption in stable zeolites. The high pressure water condensation in hydrophobic silicalite-1 was reproduced without any parameter readjustment. The method and forcefield used here should be useful for engineering oriented applications such as the prediction of multi-component mixture adsorptive separations in various stable zeolites. It allows to address the issue of the effect of the small amounts of water that are almost inevitably present in zeolite-based separation processes.},

  Abstract                 = {Using grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations of molecular models, we investigate the nature of water adsorption and desorption in slit pores with graphitelike surfaces. Special emphasis is placed on the question of whether water exhibits capillary condensation (i.e., condensation when the external pressure is below the bulk vapor pressure). Three models of water have been considered. These are the SPC and SPC/E models and a model where the hydrogen bonding is described by tetrahedrally coordinated square-well association sites. The water-carbon interaction was described by the Steele 10-4-3 potential. In addition to determining adsorption/desorption isotherms, we also locate the states where vapor-liquid equilibrium occurs for both the bulk and confined states of the models. We find that for wider pores (widths >1 nm), condensation does not occur in the GCMC simulations until the pressure is higher than the bulk vapor pressure, P0. This is consistent with a physical picture where a lack of hydrogen bonding with the graphite surface destabilizes dense water phases relative to the bulk. For narrow pores where the slit width is comparable to the molecular diameter, strong dispersion interactions with both carbon surfaces can stabilize dense water phases relative to the bulk so that pore condensation can occur for P < P0 in some cases. For the narrowest pores studied–a pore width of 0.6 nm–pore condensation is again shifted to P > P0. The phase-equilibrium calculations indicate vapor-liquid coexistence in the slit pores for P < P0 for all but the narrowest pores. We discuss the implications of our results for interpreting water adsorption/desorption isotherms in porous carbons.},

and optimization has been steadily on the rise in the past decade.
The widespread use of kriging models appears to be hampered by 1)
computationally efficient algorithms for accurately estimating the
model's parameters, 2) an effective method to assess the resulting
model's quality, and 3) the lack of guidance in selecting the appropriate
form of the kriging model. We attempt to address these issues by
comparing 1) maximum likelihood estimation and cross validation parameter
estimation methods for selecting a kriging model's parameters given
its form and 2) an R[2] of prediction and the corrected Akaike information
criterion assessment methods for quantifying the quality of the created
kriging model. These methods are demonstrated with six test problems.
Finally, different forms of kriging models are examined to determine
if more complex forms are more accurate and easier to fit than simple
forms of kriging models for approximating computer models.},

  abstract =  {A computational model is a representation of some physical or other
system of interest, first expressed mathematically and then implemented
in the form of a computer program; it may be viewed as a function
of inputs that, when evaluated, produces outputs. Motivation for
this article comes from computational models that are deterministic,
complicated enough to make classical mathematical analysis impractical
and that have a moderate-to-large number of inputs. The problem of
designing computational experiments to determine which inputs have
important effects on an output is considered. The proposed experimental
plans are composed of individually randomized one-factor-at-a-time
designs, and data analysis is based on the resulting random sample
of observed elementary effects, those changes in an output due solely
to changes in a particular input. Advantages of this approach include
a lack of reliance on assumptions of relative sparsity of important
inputs, monotonicity of outputs with respect to inputs, or adequacy
of a low-order polynomial as an approximation to the computational
model.},

  abstract =       {Mathematical models of physical systems are subject to many uncertainties such as measurement errors and uncertain initial and boundary conditions. After accounting for these uncertainties, it is often revealed that discrepancies between the model output and the observations remain; if so, the model is said to be inadequate. In practice, the inadequate model may be the best that is available or tractable, and so despite its inadequacy the model may be used to make predictions of unobserved quantities. In this case, a representation of the inadequacy is necessary, so the impact of the observed discrepancy can be determined. We investigate this problem in the context of chemical kinetics and propose a new technique to account for model inadequacy that is both probabilistic and physically meaningful. A stochastic inadequacy operator is introduced which is embedded in the ODEs describing the evolution of chemical species concentrations and which respects certain physical constraints such as conservation laws. The entries of the operator are governed by probability distributions, which in turn are characterized by a set of hyperparameters. The model parameters and hyperparameters are calibrated using high-dimensional hierarchical Bayesian inference. We apply the method to a typical problem in chemical kinetics: the reaction mechanism of hydrogen combustion.},

  Abstract                 = {A method is presented to improve the speed of convergence of Wang-Landau simulations as used to calculate the density of states of continuous systems. The density of states is first crudely estimated with calculations employing a smoothed potential-energy surface. This estimate is then used as a seed for subsequent Wang-Landau simulations using the original potential. The performance of the method is demonstrated by employing several simple models, including an analytically solvable harmonic system as well as a Go model of a protein. For all systems considered, the seeded simulations were found to converge significantly faster and with higher accuracy than the standard Wang-Landau simulations.},

  abstract =       {In order to find out capable chemical evolution step from astronomically created organic in interstellar space to biological organic on the earth, infrared spectrum of nitrogen substituted carbon pentagon-hexagon coupled polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon was analyzed by the density functional theory. Ionization was modeled from neutral to tri-cation. Among one nitrogen and two nitrogen substituted NPAH, we could find good examples showing similar IR behavior with astronomically well observed one as like C8H6N1, C7H5N2, and C7H5N2. We can imagine that such ionized NPAH may be created in interstellar space by attacks of high energy nitrogen and photon. Whereas, in case of three and four nitrogen substituted cases as like C6H4N3 and C5H3N4, there were no candidate showing similar behavior with observed one. Also, IR of typical biological organic with four and five nitrogen substituted one as like purine and adenine resulted no good similarity with observed one. By such theoretical comparison, one capable story of chemical evolution of PAH in interstellar space was that one and two nitrogen substituted carbon pentagon-hexagon molecules may have a potential to be created in interstellar space, whereas more than three nitrogen substituted molecules including biological organic purine and adenine may not be synthesized in space, possibly on the earth.},

Many of these simulators depend on factors that tune the level of precision of the response, the gain in accuracy being at a price of computational time. The contribution of this work is two-fold: firstly, we propose a quantile-based criterion for the sequential choice of experiments, in the fashion of the classical Expected Improvement criterion, which allows an elegant treatment of heterogeneous response precisions. Secondly, we present a procedure that allocates on-line the computational time given to each measurement, allowing a better distribution of the computational effort and increased efficiency. Finally, the optimization method is applied to an original application in nuclear criticality safety.},

  Abstract                 = {The relative performances of different implementations of the Wang-Landau method are assessed on two classes of systems with continuous degrees of freedom, namely, two polypeptides and two atomic Lennard-Jones clusters. Parallel tempering Monte Carlo simulations serve as a reference, and we pay particular attention to the variations of the multiplicative factor f during the course of the simulation. For the systems studied, the Wang-Landau method is found to be of comparable accuracy as parallel tempering, but has significant difficulties in reproducing low-temperature transitions exhibited by the Lennard-Jones clusters at low temperature. Using a complementary order parameter and calculating a two-dimensional joint density of states significantly improves the situation, especially for the notoriously difficult LJ(38) system. However, while parallel tempering easily converges for LJ(31), we have not been able to get data of comparable accuracy with Wang-Landau multicanonical sampling.},

  Abstract                 = {This numerical simulation paper focuses on the adsorption/desorption of water in disordered mesoporous silica glasses (Vycor-like). The numerical adsorbent was previously obtained by off lattice method, and was shown to reproduce quite well the micro- and mesotextural properties of real Vycor, as well as morphological (pore size distribution) and topological (pore interconnections) disorder. The water-water interactions are described by the SPC model while water-silica interactions are calculated in the framework of the PN-TrAZ model. The water adsorption/desorption isotherms and the configurational energies are calculated by the Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulation method. The low pressure results compare well with experiments, showing the good transferability of the intermolecular potential. It is shown that if the hysteresis loop observed in the adsorption/desorption isotherm is considered as a true phase transition (which is actually still an open question in the case of disordered porous materials), then it is possible to calculate the grand potential by applying the thermodynamic integration scheme. The grand potential is shown to be multivalued for low (subcritical) temperature, and continuous for high (supercritical) temperature. A coexistence point is found within the hysteresis loop, actually close to the vertical desorption line. Below the equilibrium chemical potential, the gaslike branch is stable whereas the liquidlike branch is metastable. The situation is reversed above the coexistence point.},

The new method is implemented to investigate the mechanical deformation of proteins. Comparisons are made with analytical results for simple model systems such as harmonic springs and Rouse chains. The method is then illustrated on a model 15-residue alanine molecule in an implicit solvent. Results for mechanical unfolding of this oligopeptide are compared to those of steered molecular dynamics calculations.},

Our approach quantifies the sensitivity of the quantities of interest with respect to the input functions as opposed to its parameters as is done in typical uncertainty quantification methods. We show that the functional sensitivity of the average potential energy and pressure in isothermal, isochoric MD simulations using Lennard-Jones two-body interactions can be used to accurately predict those properties for other interatomic potentials (with different functional forms) without re-running the simulations. This is demonstrated under three different thermodynamic conditions, namely a crystal at room temperature, a liquid at ambient pressure, and a high pressure liquid. The method provides accurate predictions as long as the change in potential does not significantly affect the region in phase space explored by the simulation. The functional uncertainty quantification approach can be used to estimate the uncertainties associated with constitutive models used in the simulation and to correct predictions if a more accurate representation becomes available.},

  abstract =    {We propose a general approach to describe large amplitude motions (LAM) with multiple degrees of freedom (DOF) in molecules or reaction intermediates, which is useful for the computation of thermochemical or kinetic data. The kinetic part of the LAM Lagrangian is derived using a Z-matrix internal coordinate representation within a new numerical procedure. This derivation is exact for a classical system, and the uncertainties on the prediction of observable quantities largely arise from uncertainties on the LAM potential energy surface (PES) itself. In order to rigorously account for these uncertainties, we present an approach based on Bayesian theory to infer a parametrized physical model of the PES using ab initio calculations. This framework allows for quantification of uncertainties associated with a PES model as well as the forward propagation of these uncertainties to the quantity of interest. A selection and generalization of some treatments accounting for the coupling of the LAM with other internal or external DOF are also presented. Finally, we discuss and validate the approach with two applications: the calculation of the partition function of 1,3-butadiene and the calculation of the high-pressure reaction rate of the CH(3) + H → CH(4) recombination.},

  Abstract                 = {Equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations were performed for a Lennard-Jones fluid at 171 conditions spanning the range 0 less than or equal to rho(+) less than or equal to 1.0 and 0.8 less than or equal to T+ less than or equal to 4.0. The Einstein or mean-squared-displacement (MSD) formula was used to compute the self-diffusion coefficient and a recently suggested, modified MSD equation was used to compute the shear viscosity at each condition. Analytical equations for the self-diffusion and viscosity coefficients were then fitted to the simulated data as polynomial functions of rho(+) and T+. The resultant smoothing equations correlate the simulated data quite well and agree with argon experimental data within the uncertainty of the data.},

  Abstract                 = {The phenomenon of water adsorption in carbon micropores is examined through the study of water adsorption equilibrium in molecular sieving carbon. Adsorption and desorption isotherms are obtained over a wide range of concentrations from less than 0.1\% to beyond 80\% of the vapor pressure. Evidence is provided in support of a proposed bimodal water adsorption mechanism that involves the interaction of water molecules with functional groups at low relative pressures and the adsorption of water molecules between graphene layers at higher pressures. Decomposition of the equilibrium isotherm data through application of the extended cooperative multimolecular sorption theory, together with favorable quantitative comparison, provides support for the proposed adsorption mechanism. Additional support is obtained from a multitemperature study of water equilibrium. Temperatures of 20, 50, and 60 degrees C were probed in this investigation in order to provide isosteric heat of adsorption data for water interaction with the carbon molecular sieve. At low loading, the derived isosteric heat of adsorption is estimated to be 69 kJ/mol. This value is indicative of the adsorption of water to functional groups. At higher loading, the isosteric heat of adsorption decreases with increasing loading and approaches the heat of condensation, indicative of adsorption between graphene layers. Further support for the proposed adsorption mechanism is derived from carbon dioxide adsorption experiments on carbon molecular sieve that is preadsorbed with various amounts of water. Significant exclusion of carbon dioxide occurs, and a quantitative analysis that is based on the proposed bimodal water adsorption mechanism is employed in this investigation.},

  abstract =  {Mathematical modelers from different disciplines and regulatory agencies
worldwide agree on the importance of a careful sensitivity analysis
(SA) of model-based inference. The most popular SA practice seen
in the literature is that of 'one-factor-at-a-time' (OAT). This consists
of analyzing the effect of varying one model input factor at a time
while keeping all other fixed. While the shortcomings of OAT are
known from the statistical literature, its widespread use among modelers
raises concern on the quality of the associated sensitivity analyses.
The present paper introduces a novel geometric proof of the inefficiency
of OAT, with the purpose of providing the modeling community with
a convincing and possibly definitive argument against OAT. Alternatives
to OAT are indicated which are based on statistical theory, drawing
from experimental design, regression analysis and sensitivity analysis
proper. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

among the various available techniques for sensitivity analysis of
model output. Practitioners can in principle describe the sensitivity
pattern of a model Y = f (X-1 , X-2, ... , X-k) with k uncertain
input factors via a full decomposition of the variance V of Y into
terms depending on the factors and their interactions. More often
practitioners are satisfied with computing just k first order effects
and k total effects, the latter describing synthetically interactions
among input factors. In sensitivity analysis a key concern is the
computational cost of the analysis, defined in terms of number of
evaluations of f(X-1 , X-2, ... , X-k) needed to complete the analysis.
as f(X-1 , X-2, ... , X-k) is often in the form of a numerical model
which may take long processing time. While the computational cost
is relatively cheap and weakly dependent on k for estimating first
order effects, it remains expensive and strictly k-dependent for
total effect indices. In the present note we compare existing and
new practices for this index and offer recommendations on which to
use. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We prove error bounds on the Hellinger distance between the true posterior distribution and various approximations based on the Gaussian process emulator. Our analysis includes approximations based on the mean of the predictive process, as well as approximations based on the full Gaussian process emulator. Our results show that the Hellinger distance between the true posterior and its approximations can be bounded by moments of the error in the emulator. Numerical results confirm our theoretical findings.},

Methods to estimate the reference value have been proposed that rest on the idea of finding a so-called consistent subset of laboratories, that is, eliminating allegedly outlying participants. We propose an alternative statistical model that accommodates all participant data and incorporates the dispersion of the measurement values obtained by different laboratories into the total uncertainty of the various estimates. This model recognizes the fact that the dispersion of values between laboratories often is substantially larger than the measurement uncertainties provided by the participating laboratories. We illustrate the methods on data from key comparison CCQM-K25. },

  Abstract                 = {A recent paper (Yonetani, Chem. Phys. Lett. 2005, 406, 49-53) shows that in computer simulations of TIP3P water (Jorgensen et al. J. Chem. Phys. 1983, 79, 926-935) a strange layer formation can occur when a long cutoff is used. This result is counterintuitive because, in principle, increasing the cutoff should give more accurate results. Here we test this finding for different water models and try to explain why layer formation occurs. In doing so we find that under certain conditions, layer formation coincides with a sharp density increase to 1050 g/L, while simultaneously a pressure of 600 bar develops and water diffusion becomes anisotropic. This leads us to conclude that a group-based cutoff (of at least 1.4 nm) stabilizes an anomalous phase with most water models. In some cases the ordering is strengthened further by periodicity in the simulation cell, but periodicity effects can even be observed with a short cutoff (0.9 nm) and a relatively large box of 4 nm. Water models that have a relatively large quadrupole moment, more in accord with the experimental gas-phase values, in particular TIP4P (Jorgensen et al. J. Chem. Phys. 1983, 79, 926-935), are much less affected by the problem, because the dipole-dipole interaction is quenched at long distance. A comparison of different cutoff treatments, namely truncation, reaction field, particle mesh Ewald (PME), and switch and shift functions, for the simulation of water shows that only PME and shift functions yield realistic dipole-dipole interactions at long distance. The impact for biomolecular simulations is discussed.},

A first method consists in computing the shear viscosity using the Green-Kubo formalism from the pressure tensor correlation function obtained from equilibrium simulations. On the other hand, the Newtonian viscosity can be extracted from the shear rate dependence of the viscosity in nonequilibrium simulations using the mode-coupling theory and the standard Cross and Carreau equations. We show that both methods lead to the same viscosity value, provided that the simulation time is long enough for the first method (much longer than advocated in the literature) and that special care is taken in the extrapolation procedure of the latter (simulations must be performed at very low shear rate). The force field employed in this work leads to an overestimation of the viscosity, with respect to experiment, by a factor ranging between 6 and 4 in the 293 K to 500 K temperature domain.},

and TIP4P/2005) is analyzed. For that purpose the predictions for
ten different properties of water are investigated, namely: 1. vapour-liquid
equilibria (VLE) and critical temperature; 2. surface tension; 3.
densities of the different solid structures of water (ices); 4. phase
diagram; 5. melting-point properties; 6. maximum in the density of
water at room pressure and thermal coefficients alpha and KT; 7.
structure of liquid water and ice; 8. equation of state at high pressures;
9. self-diffusion coefficient; 10. dielectric constant. For each
property, the performance of each model is analyzed in detail with
a critical discussion of the possible reason of the success or failure
of the model. A final judgement on the quality of these models is
provided. TIP4P/2005 provides the best description of almost all
properties of the list, the only exception being the dielectric constant.
In second position, TIP5P and TIP4P yield a similar performance overall,
and the last place with the poorest description of the water properties
is provided by TIP3P. The ideas leading to the proposal and design
of the TIP4P/2005 are also discussed in detail. TIP4P/2005 is probably
close to the best description of water that can be achieved with
a non-polarizable model described by a single Lennard-Jones (LJ)
site and three charges.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe an efficient Monte Carlo algorithm using a random walk in energy space to obtain a very accurate estimate of the density of states for classical statistical models. The density of states is modified at each step when the energy level is visited to produce a flat histogram. By carefully controlling the modification factor, we allow the density of states to converge to the true value very quickly, even for large systems. From the density of states at the end of the random walk, we can estimate thermodynamic quantities such as internal energy and specific heat capacity by calculating canonical averages at any temperature. Using this method, we not only can avoid repeating simulations at multiple temperatures, but we can also estimate the free energy and entropy, quantities that are not directly accessible by conventional Monte Carlo simulations. This algorithm is especially useful for complex systems with a rough landscape since all possible energy levels are visited with the same probability. As with the multicanonical Monte Carlo technique, our method overcomes the tunneling barrier between coexisting phases at first-order phase transitions. In this paper, we apply our algorithm to both first- and second-order phase transitions to demonstrate its efficiency and accuracy. We obtained direct simulational estimates for the density of states for two-dimensional ten-state Potts models on lattices up to 200 x 200 and Ising models on lattices up to 256 x 256. Our simulational results are compared to both exact solutions and existing numerical data obtained using other methods. Applying this approach to a three-dimensional +/-J spin-glass model, we estimate the internal energy and entropy at zero temperature; and, using a two-dimensional random walk in energy and order-parameter space, we obtain the (rough) canonical distribution and energy landscape in order-parameter space. Preliminary data suggest that the glass transition temperature is about 1.2 and that better estimates can be obtained with more extensive application of the method. This simulational method is not restricted to energy space and can be used to calculate the density of states for any parameter by a random walk in the corresponding space.},

  abstract =    {Force field parameters used in classical molecular simulations can
be estimated from quantum mechanical calculations or spectroscopic
measurements. This especially applies to bonded interactions such
as bond-stretching, bond-bending, and torsional interactions. However,
it is difficult and computational expensive to obtain accurate parameters
describing the nonbonded van der Waals interactions from quantum
mechanics. In many studies, these parameters are adjusted to reproduce
experimental data, such as vapor-liquid equilibria (VLE) data. Adjusting
these force field parameters to VLE data is currently a cumbersome
and computationally expensive task. The reason is that the result
of a calculation of the vapor-liquid equilibria depends on the van
der Waals interactions of all atom types in the system, therefore
requiring many time-consuming iterations. In this work, we use an
analytical equation of state, the perturbed chain statistical associating
fluid theory (PC-SAFT), to predict the results of molecular simulations
for VLE. The analytical PC-SAFT equation of state is used to approximate
the objective function f(p) as a function of the array of force field
parameters p. The objective function is here for example defined
as the deviations of vapor pressure, enthalpy of vaporization and
liquid density data, with respect to experimental data. The parameters
are optimized using the analytical PC-SAFT equation of state, which
is orders of magnitude quicker to calculate than molecular simulation.
The solution is an excellent approximation of the real objective
function, so that the resulting method requires only very few molecular
simulation runs to converge. The method is here illustrated by optimizing
transferable Lennard-Jones parameters for the n-alkane series. Optimizing
four force field parameters p = ($\epsilon$(CH(2))(CH(2)), $\epsilon$(CH(3))(CH(3)),
$\sigma$(CH(2))(CH(2)), $\sigma$(CH(3))(CH(3))) we obtain excellent agreement of
coexisting densities, vapor pressure and caloric properties within
only 2 -3 molecular simulation runs.},

  abstract =       {We present results of an investigation into the formation of nitrogen-bearing molecules in the atmosphere of Titan. We extend a previous model (Li et al. 2015, 2016) to cover the region below the tropopause, so the new model treats the atmosphere from Titan's surface to an altitude of 1500 km. We consider the effects of condensation and sublimation using a continuous, numerically stable method. This is coupled with parameterized treatments of the sedimentation of the aerosols and their condensates, and the formation of haze particles. These processes affect the abundances of heavier species such as the nitrogen-bearing molecules, but have less effect on the abundances of lighter molecules. Removal of molecules to form aerosols also plays a role in determining the mixing ratios, in particular of HNC, HC3N and HCN. We find good agreement with the recently detected mixing ratios of C2H5CN, with condensation playing an important role in determining the abundance of this molecule below 500 km. Of particular interest is the chemistry of acrylonitrile (C2H3CN) which has been suggested by Stevenson et al. (2015) as a molecule that could form biological membranes in an oxygen-deficient environment. With the inclusion of haze formation we find good agreement of our model predictions of acrylonitrile with the available observations.},

  abstract =  {Recent publications have suggested that the systematic sensitivity
analysis approach (SSAP) commonly used in engineering problems and
atomic/molecular scattering problems is also useful for analyzing
structural relationships and estimating the uncertainties of results
from molecular mechanics and free energy calculations. Here we demonstrate
that, by performing a principal component analysis (PCA) of the results
from a sensitivity analysis, it is possible to identify a subset
of parameters (possibly small in many instances) of a potential energy
function that are most important in determining the value of a free
energy difference (DELTA-A = A2 - A1 where A2 and A1 correspond to
free energy of system 2 and system 1, respectively). Consequently,
the uncertainty of DELTA-A due to the use of nonoptimal parameters
of a potential energy function is mainly determined by the uncertainties
of a smaller number of parameters of the potential energy function.
We also show that the SSAP and the PCA methods can help to choose
experimental data to use for the refinement of the parameters of
a potential energy function. In general, a PCA allows for the identification
of the set(s) of parameters that act in a correlated fashion to most
(or best) influence the observables. A PCA may also be applied to
molecular mechanics, and the concepts may be generalized to the analysis
of molecular dynamics.},

  Abstract                 = {A one-parameter model constitutive transport equation for the viscosity of the Lennard-Jones (L-J) fluid that is accurate for all equilibrium states of liquid and gas is proposed: eta(rho*, T*) = eta(0)(T*)[1 + B-eta(*)(T*)rho* + C-AH(1/T*)(1/3)(rho*)(4)] The form of this equation is based upon the soft-sphere scaling laws for the residual density-dependent viscosity discovered originally by Ashurst and Hoover and uses their empirical coefficient (C-AH). Enskog's density-independent limit theoretical term (eta(0)) is included to reproduce the viscosity in the limit of zero density accurately. Remaining discrepancies at low temperatures, for both gas and liquid densities, are largely removed when the linear-density Rainwater-Friend coefficient is added. The equation is comparable in accuracy to the 24-parameter empirical equation of state proposed by Rowley and Painter. Comparison with this correlation and previous MD results reveals a discrepancy near the triple point. To test the equation, new MD data for three fluid states are reported. Here, the viscosity is computed from time correlation functions resolved into the single-particle auto- and cross-correlation terms. It is found that, at high density (rho* > 0.8), the cross-correlations extend beyond 7 sigma, (molecule diameters) and oscillate in sign. This explains the wide scatter of previous MD viscosities for small L-J systems. (c) 2005 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 52: 438-446, 2006},

  Abstract                 = {Recently, we have extended the combined sensitivity analysis/molecular dynamics method(1,2) to identify the most important parameters of the flexible SPC and TIP3P water models in determining the thermodynamical and structural properties of liquid water.(3,4) Since the SPC and the TIP3P models do not include molecular polarizability explicitly, it is difficult to examine the role of molecular polarizability in determining the properties of liquid water. In this paper, we carry out a sensitivity analysis on a newly developed polarizable water model. We have systematically investigated the possible responses of the structural and thermodynamical properties of this polarizable water model when the potential parameters of the model are perturbed. Discovered is the particularly important role of molecular polarization in describing the properties of liquid water. On the other hand, the use of a point-charge, rather than a dispersed-charge, model appears to be adequate for simulating liquid water. In conjunction with the results obtained from our previous studies,(3,4) these findings provide useful hints for improving water models.},

  abstract =  {We have carried out sensitivity analysis studies to identify the most
important potential parameters of the SPC and the TIP3P flexible
water models in determining three distribution functions of liquid
water-the site-site radial distribution functions, the distribution
function of the interaction energy of a water molecule with its surrounding
[P(u)(u(b))], and the distribution function of the local electric
field at the oxygen of a water molecule projected along the permanent
dipole moment vector of the water molecule [P(e)(E.mu0)]. The site-site
radial distribution functions of each water model are most sensitive
to the equilibrium O-H bond length (r(OH)) and the Lennard-Jones
radius (sigma) of the model. In addition to these two parameters,
the cut-off radius (R(cut)) in the reaction field geometry and the
atomic partial charges are also important in affecting P(u)(u(b))
of each model, especially the wings of the distribution. The oxygen
charge affects the low energy wing of P(u)(u(b)) more than the high
energy wing, whereas the hydrogen charge mainly affects the high
energy wing and has little effect on the low energy wing of the distribution.
As for P(e)(E.mu0), which provides an indirect check of the validity
of the effective charge approximation in accounting for molecular
polarizability, the leading factors are r(OH), sigma, and R(cut).
These parameters affect the distribution wings of P(e)(E.mu0) the
most. The key advantage of the sensitivity analysis technique is
that it provides a systematic and economical means for studying the
role of each parameter of a water model in affecting the properties
of the model.},

found that the determinative factors for the Helmholtz free energy

a predominating role in evaluating the thermodynamic pressure. On
the other hand, the statistical entropy, the heat capacity at constant
volume, and the thermal pressure coefficient are mainly controlled
by the parameters relating to the 0-H bond stretching. In addition,
the Kirkwood G(k) factor is quite sensitive to the cutoff radius
in the reaction field geometry. This study helps understand the thermodynamics
