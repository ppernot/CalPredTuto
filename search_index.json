["intro.html", "Chapitre 1 Introduction", " Chapitre 1 Introduction You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 1. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 3. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 1.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 1.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 1.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 1.1: Here is a nice table!

["stat-model.html", "Chapitre 2 Statistical modeling of calibration data 2.1 Calibration models", " Chapitre 2 Statistical modeling of calibration data 2.1 Calibration models One considers datasets of the type \\(D=\\{x_i,y_i\\}_{i=1}^N\\) where \\(x\\) is the control variable, and \\(y\\) the dependent variable. A calibration model \\(m(.;\\theta)\\) with parameters \\(\\theta\\) links these variables \\[\\begin{equation} y_i = m(x_i;\\theta) + \\epsilon_i, \\tag{2.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\epsilon_i\\) is an additive noise variable to be defined according to the available information on data uncertainty. 2.1.1 Random errors In many cases, one assumes that random errors are described by a normal distribution centered at zero \\[\\begin{equation} \\epsilon_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma_i), \\tag{2.2} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\sigma_i\\) is the standard deviation of measurements at \\(x_i\\), which might be constant. 2.1.2 Systematic errors The GUM (BIPM et al. 2008) recommends to incorporate systematic errors in the measurement model. What remains in the uncertainty model is the uncertainty on such corrections. However, the measurement uncertainties published in the scientific or technical literature often result from the combination of random and systematic contributions. In such cases, a variance-covariance matrix (\\(\\Sigma_y\\)) should ideally be provided with the data (BIPM et al. 2011). The error variables are no longer statistically independent and should be described as \\[\\begin{equation} \\{\\epsilon_i\\}_{i=1}^N \\sim \\mathcal{N}_N(0,\\Sigma_y), \\tag{2.3} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\mathcal{N}_N(.,.)\\) is a \\(N\\)-variate normal distribution. Unfortunately, it is rarely the case that \\(\\Sigma_y\\) is available, or when available it might be corrupted by excessive rounding. The modeler has therefore often to build \\(\\Sigma_y\\) from limited information, and/or to do some reverse uncertainty engineering, i.e. to infer the respective contributions of both error types. Note that this is possible only in a limited number of cases, and with strong hypotheses on the contributions. Considering two error sources, one redefines the calibration model \\[\\begin{equation} y_i = m(x_i;\\theta) + \\epsilon_{i,r} + \\epsilon_s, \\tag{2.4} \\end{equation}\\] where \\[\\begin{equation} \\epsilon_{r,s} \\sim N(0,u^2_{r,s}). \\tag{2.5} \\end{equation}\\] \\(u_r\\) et \\(u_s\\) are unknown with constraint \\[\\begin{equation} u_r^2 + u_s^2 = u_{tot}^2 \\tag{2.6} \\end{equation}\\] The covariance of two measurements is \\[\\begin{equation} {\\rm Cov}(y_i,y_j) = u_r^2\\ \\delta_{ij} + u_s^2 \\tag{2.7} \\end{equation}\\] One can also express the covariance matrix using a correlation coefficient \\(\\rho\\) \\[\\begin{equation} \\boldsymbol{U}=u^{2}_{tot}\\left(\\begin{array}{cccc} 1 &amp; \\rho &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\rho\\\\ \\rho &amp; 1 &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots\\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\rho\\\\ \\rho &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\rho &amp; 1 \\end{array}\\right), \\ {\\rm with}\\ \\rho=\\frac{u^2_{s}}{u^2_{tot}} \\tag{2.8} \\end{equation}\\] References "],
