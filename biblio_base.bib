Thus these processes remain highly parameterized in models of planetary atmospheres. The authors have developed instrumentation for simultaneously measuring the net prodn. rates of complex gas-phase hydrocarbons and of org. aerosols formed from irradiating mixts. of simple precursor gases through online quadruple mass spectrometry measurements of stable gas-phase species and in situ optical scattering detection of the particulates at 633 nm. The new technique and results for the generation of hydrocarbon aerosol from the irradn. of pure, gas phase CH4 at a pressure of 70 Torr with 8.8 +- 0.8 * 1015 photons s-1 of vacuum UV light (120-300 nm) are reported. The net prodn. rates for the following gaseous species are measured: H2 = 9.9 +- 2.2 . 1011, C2H2 = 2.8 +- 0.5 . 1010, C2H4 = 5.5 +- 9.4 . 109, C2H6 = 8.6 +- 2.5 . 1010, C3H4 = 2.5 +- 1.2 . 109, C4H2 = 6.6 +- 5.0 . 108, C4H10 = 1.3 +- 0.5 . 1010 cm-3 s-1. The prodn. of hydrocarbon particulates is detected by optical scattering, and the condensed phase C-C bond formation rate is inferred to be 7.5 +- 3.1 . 1011 cm-3 s-1. Applications of this technique to the atmospheres of Titan and terrestrial-like planets, such as the early Earth before the rise of mol. oxygen, are discussed. [on SciFinder (R)]},

These have differing strengths and limitations for the determination of recombination rate constants/cross-sections, including those as a function of temperature/energy, and for the identification and quantification of the neutral products, both rovibronically excited and ground state. Here, the afterglow techniques will be reviewed (the storage ring is considered by Larsson) with emphasis on new developments. In this vein, there will be discussion of (i) rate constants for larger species, (ii) temperature dependencies of rate constants including those for some isomers, and (iii) electronically excited states; all these connect with other papers in these proceedings. New developments are discussed; in particular a means of quantifying the neutral product distributions, and possible new directions are suggested.},

  Abstract                 = {Electron-ion dissociative recombination is an important ionization loss process in any ionized gas containing molecular ions. This includes the interstellar medium, circumstellar shells, cometary comae, planetary ionospheres, fusion plasma boundaries, combustion flames, laser plasmas and chemical deposition and etching plasmas. In addition to controlling the ionization density, the process generates many radical species, which can contribute to a parallel neutral chemistry. Techniques used to obtain rate data and product information (flowing afterglows and storage rings) are discussed and recent data are reviewed including diatomic to polyatomic ions and cluster ions. The data are divided into rate coefficients and cross sections, including their temperature/energy dependencies, and quantitative identification of neutral reaction products. The latter involve both ground and electronically excited states and including vibrational excitation. The data from the different techniques are compared and trends in the data are examined. The reactions are considered in terms of the basic mechanisms (direct and indirect processes including tunneling) and recent theoretical developments are discussed. Finally, new techniques are mentioned (for product identification; electrostatic storage rings, including single and double rings; Coulomb explosion) and new ways forward are suggested. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Furthermore, we suggest that the dense and cold exo-ionosphere (from the exobase at 1430 km and outward to several Titan radii from the surface) can be explained by magnetospheric forcing and other transport processes whereas exospheric ionisation by impacting low energy electrons seems to play a minor role.},

  Abstract                 = {A key step in valuing petroleum investment opportunities is to construct a model that portrays the uncertainty inherent in the investment decision. In almost all such cases, several of the random variables that are relevant for the model are correlated. Properly accounting for and modelling these correlations is essential in deriving reliable valuations for decision support. The Envelope method and the Iman-Conover method are popular approaches to model dependency in the petroleum industry. Although these models work well in many cases, there are situations where they fail to accurately account for important characteristics of the correlations. In many cases the structure of the dependence between two random variables is important. The approaches typically used to model dependence in oil and gas evaluations often fail to address the dependence structure. The copulas technique, which is well known in financial risk management and insurance applications, has proven to be a superior tool for modelling dependency structures. Yet, to our knowledge, it has rarely been used in petroleum applications. A copula is a statistical concept that relates random variables. It is a function that links the marginal distributions to the joint distribution. A copula can model the dependence structure given any type of marginal distribution, which is not possible with other correlation measures. This is illustrated by the fact that the copula approach is able to separate the marginal distribution from the correlation. The objective of this paper is to illustrate the potential benefits of using copulas to model dependencies in oil and gas applications with a particular focus on the reserves problem. This paper introduces the copulas method and then compares and contrasts it with some of the more commonly used approaches to model dependence. We then show that the traditional methods have problems in accurately revealing the dependence structure in the tails of the variable distributions. Finally, we illustrate how the dependence structure can be captured and modelled using the copulas approach.},

  Abstract                 = {Energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) are formed when singly charged magnetospheric ions undergo charge exchange with exospheric neutral atoms. The energy of the incident ions is almost entirely transferred to the charge exchange produced ENAs, which then propagate along nearly rectilinear ballistic trajectories. Thus the ENAs can be used like \"photons\" in order to form an image of the energetic ion distribution. The Cassini spacecraft will be equipped with INCA, a magnetospheric imaging energetic neutral atom camera [Mitchell et al., 1993]. In this context, we undertook the study of the energetic neutral atom prodn. resulting from the interaction of Titan's exosphere with Saturn's magnetosphere. This necessitated the development of a model for the altitude d. profile and compn. of both the inner and the outer exosphere of Titan. We used the Chamberlain model for the inner exosphere (altitude < 6000 km) that included the five major species: H, H2, N, N2, and CH4. In the lower part of the exosphere, where our model overlaps the high altitude end of existing lower atm. models, the results are compatible. The d. and compn. profiles obtained from our model were then used to calc. the ENA prodn., considering a proton spectrum measured by Voyager in the Saturnian magnetosphere as the parent ion population. It is shown how the exospheric species contribute in a different way, as a function of the altitude, to the ENA flux spectra. In the outer exosphere (altitude > 6000 km), mol. hydrogen is the dominant species, and we utilized a Chamberlain model to est. the ENA intensities several Titan radii from the moon. The Titan exosphere is nearly as bright in ENA as the inner magnetosphere of Saturn, making it possible to image the exosphere out to at least 5 Titan radii, and even to resolve it when the spacecraft is several Saturn radii distant from the moon. Our results also show that the magnetospheric imaging technique via energetic neutral atom detection is a powerful diagnostic tool for the interaction of Saturn's magnetosphere with Titan and for the remote sensing of the compn. profile of Titan's exosphere.

  Abstract                 = {The results of a study of the ion-molecule reactions of N+, N2+, and HCN+ with methane, acetylene, and ethylene are reported. These studies were performed using the FA-SIFT at the University of Canterbury. The reactions studied here are important to understanding the ion chemistry in Titan's atmosphere. N+ and N2+ are the primary ions formed by photo-ionization and electron impact in Titan's ionosphere and drive Titan's ion chemistry. It is therefore very important to know how these ions react with the principal trace neutral species in Titan's atmosphere: Methane, acetylene, and ethylene. While these reactions have been studied before the product channels have been difficult to define as several potential isobaric products make a definitive answer difficult. Mass overlap causes difficulties in making unambiguous species assignments in these systems. Two discriminators have been used in this study to resolve the mass overlap problem. They are deuterium labeling and also the differences in reactivities of each isobar with various neutral reactants. Several differences have been found from the products in previous work. The HCN+ ion is important in both Titan's atmosphere and in the laboratory.},

  Abstract                 = {The results of a study of ion-mol. reactions occurring in pure methane, acetylene, ethylene, ethane, propyne, propene, propane, and diacetylene at pressures up to 40 m of pressure are reported. A variety of exptl. methods are used: the std. double resonance in an ICR, for detn. of the precursor ions and the modulated double resonance ejection in an ICR, for the detn. of the daughter ions. The FA-SIFT technique was used for validation and examn. of termol. reactions with rate coeffs. that are less than 10-26 cm6 s-1. An extensive database of reaction kinetics already exists for many of these reactions. The main point of this study was the detn. of the accuracy of this database and to search for any missing reactions and reaction channels that may have been omitted from earlier investigations. A specific objective of this work was to extend the study to the highest pressures possible to find out if there were any important termol. reaction channels occurring. A new approach was used here. In the pure hydrocarbon gases the mass spectra were followed as a function of the pressure changes of the gas. An initial guess was first made using the current literature as a source of the reaction kinetics that were expected. A model of the ion abundances was produced from the soln. of the partial differential equations in terms of reaction rate coeffs. and initial abundances. The exptl. data was fitted to the model for all of the pressures by a least squares minimization to the reaction rate coeffs. and initial abundances. The reaction rate coeffs. obtained from the model were then compared to the literature values. Several new channels and reactions were discovered when the modeled fits were compared to the actual data. This is all explained in the text and the implications of these results are discussed for the Titan atm. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  Abstract                 = {The Cholesky decomposition is a widely used method to draw samples from multivariate normal distribution with non-singular covariance matrices. In this work we introduce a simple method by using singular value decomposition (SVD) to simulate multivariate normal data even if the covariance matrix is singular, which is often the case in chemometric problems. The covariance matrix can be specified by the user or can be generated by specifying a subset of the eigenvalues. The latter can be an advantage for simulating data sets with a particular latent structure. This can be useful for testing the performance of chemometric methods with data sets matching the theoretical conditions for their applicability; checking their robustness when the hypothesized properties fail; or generating data from multi-stage or multi-phase processes.},

  Abstract                 = {Reactions of methane cations, CH4+, with H2, HD and D2 have been studied in a variable temperature 22-pole ion trap from room temperature down to 15 K. The formation of CH5+ in collisions with H2 is slow at 300 K, but it becomes faster by at least one order of magnitude when the temperature is lowered to 15 K. This behavior is tentatively explained with a longer complex lifetime at low temperatures. However, since tunneling is most probably not responsible for product formation, other dynamical or statistical restrictions must be responsible for the negative temperature dependence. In collisions of CH4+ with HD, the CH5+ product ion (68% at 15 K) prevails over CH4D+ (32%). Reaction of CH4+ with D2 is found to be much slower than with H2 or HD. The rate coefficient for converting CH4+ into CH3D+ by H-D exchange has been determined to be smaller than 10-12 cm3/s, indicating that scrambling in the CH6+ complex is very unlikely.},

  Abstract                 = {Methane is key to sustaining Titan's thick nitrogen atmosphere. However, methane is destroyed and converted to heavier hydrocarbons irreversibly on a relatively short timescale of approximately 10-100 million years. Without the warming provided by CH4-generated hydrocarbon hazes in the stratosphere and the pressure induced opacity in the infrared, particularly by CH4-N2 and H2-N2 collisions in the troposphere, the atmosphere could be gradually reduced to as low as tens of millibar pressure. An understanding of the source-sink cycle of methane is thus crucial to the evolutionary history of Titan and its atmosphere. In this paper we propose that a complex photochemical-meteorological-hydrogeochemical cycle of methane operates on Titan. We further suggest that although photochemistry leads to the loss of methane from the atmosphere, conversion to a global ocean of ethane is unlikely. The behavior of methane in the troposphere and the surface, as measured by the Cassini-Huygens gas chromatograph mass spectrometer, together with evidence of cryovolcanism reported by the Cassini visual and infrared mapping spectrometer, represents a "methalogical" cycle on Titan, somewhat akin to the hydrological cycle on Earth. In the absence of net loss to the interior, it would represent a closed cycle. However, a source is still needed to replenish the methane lost to photolysis. A hydrogeochemical source deep in the interior of Titan holds promise. It is well known that in serpentinization, hydration of ultramafic silicates in terrestrial oceans produces H2(aq), whose reaction with carbon grains or carbon dioxide in the crustal pores produces methane gas. Appropriate geological, thermal, and pressure conditions could have existed in and below Titan's purported water-ammonia ocean for "low-temperature" serpentinization to occur in Titan's accretionary heating phase. On the other hand, impacts could trigger the process at high temperatures. In either instance, storage of methane as a stable clathrate-hydrate in Titan's interior for later release to the atmosphere is quite plausible. There is also some likelihood that the production of methane on Titan by serpentinization is a gradual and continuous on-going process.},

A crucial step in the process involves a gas phase reaction of N2H4 with H. The most favorable conditions for this step would be the intermediate prodn. of a CH4-H2 greenhouse capable of raising the gas temp. to 150 K. Subsequently, .apprx.20 bars of N2 could have evolved. The pressure-induced opacity of 20 bars of N2 should suffice to explain the recently measured 200 K surface temp. Unlike the situation of Jupiter, NH3 is not recycled on Titan by reactions involving N2 or N2H4. This may explain the failure of recent attempts to detect NH3 in the upper atm. of Titan.

Interpretation of the C2H2 d. profile with photochem. models leads to a value of (5 - 10) * 103 cm2s-1 for the eddy diffusion coeff. (Kh) at the Uranus homopause, which for these limits of Kh corresponds to 354 km (0.037 mb) and 390 km (0.02 mb) above the 1-bar level. The eddy coeff. derived from these globally averaged observations is found to be in agreement with the values obtained by Voyager for the equatorial-low latitudes ten years earlier. The ISO-Voyager consistency in Kh indicates that whatever little manifestable internal energy Uranus possesses may still be adequate and responsible for controlling the behavior of vertical mixing in its visible atm., and that the dynamical behavior of the upper atm. is fairly uniform over the planet. In Dec. 1997, Me radicals (CH3) were also detected by ISO/SWS in the atm. of Saturn. The derived stratospheric column abundance of CH3, (1.5-7.5) * 1013 cm-2, is about a factor of 10 smaller than the predictions of methane photochem. models, however. The discrepancy could be explained by one of two means: either the value of the eddy diffusion coeff. used in the models - the Voyager value - is too high by at least a factor of 100, or the rate const. for the self-reaction loss of CH3 is too low by at least a factor of 10. It is argued that Kh could not possibly be reduced so drastically from the Voyager epoch. Instead, we believe the source of the discrepancy between the ISO derived CH3 and the model calcns. lies in the poor knowledge of lab. chem. kinetics data on certain CH3 loss reactions, which has serious implications for the interpretation of observations of atmospheres of the giant planets and Titan.

We address this problem by reporting reflection–absorption infrared spectra (RAIRS) of cryogenic HF–H2O binary mixtures at various compositions prepared as nanoscopic films using molecular beam techniques. Optical constants for these cryogenic solutions [n($\omega$) and k($\omega$)] are obtained by iteratively solving Fresnel equations for stratified media. Modeling of the experimental RAIRS spectra allow for a quantitative interpretation of the complex interplay between multiple reflections, optical interference and absorption effects. The evolution of the strong absorption features in the intermediate 1000–3000 cm$^{-1}$ range with increasing HF concentration reveals the presence of various ionic dissociation intermediates that are trapped in the disordered H-bonded network of cryogenic hydrofluoric acid solutions. Our findings are discussed in light of the conventional interpretation of why hydrofluoric acid is a weak acid revealing molecular-level details of the mechanism for HF ionization that may be relevant to analogous elementary processes involved in the ionization of weak acids in aqueous solutions.},

  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT Numerous studies over the past 30 years have suggested there is a causal connection between the motion of the Sun through the Galaxy and terrestrial mass extinctions or climate change. Proposed mechanisms include comet impacts (via perturbation of the Oort cloud), cosmic rays and supernovae, the effects of which are modulated by the passage of the Sun through the Galactic midplane or spiral arms. Supposed periodicities in the fossil record, impact cratering dates or climate proxies over the Phanerozoic (past 545 Myr) are frequently cited as evidence in support of these hypotheses. This remains a controversial subject, with many refutations and replies having been published. Here I review both the mechanisms and the evidence for and against the relevance of astronomical phenomena to climate change and evolution. This necessarily includes a critical assessment of time series analysis techniques and hypothesis testing. Some of the studies have suffered from flaws in methodology, in particular drawing incorrect conclusions based on ruling out a null hypothesis. I conclude that there is little evidence for intrinsic periodicities in biodiversity, impact cratering or climate on timescales of tens to hundreds of Myr. Although this does not rule out the mechanisms, the numerous assumptions and uncertainties involved in the interpretation of the geological data and in particular in the astronomical mechanisms suggest that Galactic midplane and spiral arm crossings have little impact on biological or climate variation above background level. Non-periodic impacts and terrestrial mechanisms (volcanism, plate tectonics, sea level changes), possibly occurring simultaneously, remain likely causes of many environmental catastrophes. Internal dynamics of the biosphere may also play a role. In contrast, there is little evidence supporting the idea that cosmic rays have a significant influence on climate through cloud formation. It seems likely that more than one mechanism has contributed to biodiversity variations over the past half Gyr.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a quantitative analysis of CO thermal emissions discovered on the nightside of Titan by Baines et al. [2005. The atmospheres of Saturn and Titan in the near-infrared: First results of Cassini/VIMS. Earth, Moon, and Planets, 96, 119-147]. in Cassini/VIMS spectral imagery. We identify these emission features as the P and R branches of the 1-0 vibrational band of carbon monoxide (CO) near 4.65 [mu]m. For CH3D, the prominent Q branch of the [nu]2 fundamental band of CH3D near 4.55 [mu]m is apparent. CO2 emissions from the strong v3 vibrational band are virtually absent, indicating a CO2 abundance several orders of magnitude less than CO, in agreement with previous investigations. Analysis of CO emission spectra obtained over a variety of altitudes on Titan's nightside limb indicates that the stratospheric abundance of CO is 32+/-15 ppm, and together with other recent determinations, suggests a vertical distribution of CO nearly constant at this value from the surface throughout the troposphere to at least the stratopause near 300 km altitude. The corresponding total atmospheric content of CO in Titan is ~2.9+/-1.5x1014 kg. Given the long lifetime of CO in the oxygen-poor Titan atmosphere (~0.5-1.0 Gyr), we find a mean CO atmospheric production rate of 6+/-3x105 kg yr-1. Given the lack of primordial heavy noble gases observed by Huygens [Niemann et al., 2005. The abundances of constituents of Titan's atmosphere from the GCMS on the Huygens probe. Nature, 438, 779-784], the primary source of atmospheric CO is likely surface emissions. The implied CO/CH4 mixing ratio of near-surface material is 1.8+/-0.9x10-4, based on an average methane surface emission rate over the past 0.5 Gyr of 1.3x10-13 gm cm-2 s-1 as required to balance hydrocarbon haze production via methane photolysis [Wilson and Atreya, 2004. Current state of modeling the photochemistry of Titan's mutually dependent atmosphere and ionosphere. J. Geophys. Res. 109, E06002 Doi:10.1029/2003JE002181]. This low CO/CH4 ratio is much lower than expected for the sub-nebular formation region of Titan and supports the hypothesis [e.g., Atreya et al., 2005. Methane on Titan: photochemical-meteorological-hydrogeochemical cycle. Bull. Am. Astron. Soc. 37, 735] that the conversion of primordial CO and other carbon-bearing materials into CH4-enriched clathrate-hydrates occurs within the deep interior of Titan via the release of hydrogen through the serpentinization process followed by Fischer-Tropsch catalysis. The time-averaged predicted emission rate of methane-rich surface materials is ~0.02 km3 yr-1, a value significantly lower than the rate of silicate lava production for the Earth and Venus, but nonetheless indicative of significant active geological processes reshaping the surface of Titan.},

  Abstract                 = {We quantify the charge states of submicrometer aerosols and arom. macromols. in Titan's org. haze. The aerosol charge is balanced between the recombination of pos. ions with the aerosol plus the ejection of electrons from the aerosol via the UV-driven photoelec. effect and the recombination of electrons with the aerosol. During the day, the dominant charge state for submicrometer aerosols is pos. Macromols. composed of fewer than 32 carbon atoms with low electron affinities (<1.0 eV) are neutral, while the rest are mainly neutral and neg. charged with a small fraction (.apprx.10%) becoming pos. charged at higher (>=300 km) altitudes. At night, Titan's aerosol population becomes uniformly neutral and neg. charged. The time taken for a nighttime aerosol to change from being neg. charged to its most probable daytime pos. charge is on the order of a few seconds for the largest submicrometer aerosols, while macromols. tend to persist in an anionic charge state for one to several Earth days. Charging strongly influences aerosol agglomeration via Coulomb attraction and may account for the seasonal variations in the albedo of the Titan haze at midrange (.apprx.200-250 km) altitudes. Enhanced agglomeration may also efficiently produce a source of condensation nuclei for the daily rainout of methane. In addn., the difference in aerosol charge between Titan's day and night (or summer and winter) phases will produce dramatically different chemistries which must be accounted for in future photochem. models. Finally, if there are PAH-like macromols. in the Titan haze, Cassini Huygens should be able to observe these charge differences, with neutral macromols. emitting strongly at 3.3 and 11.2 mm, cationic macromols. emitting between 6.2 and 8.6 mm, and anionic macromols. emitting in both IR spectral regions.

  Abstract                 = {A brief review. Modern and fossil chemosynthetic communities based on the consumption of gases (carbon dioxide, methane, hydrogen sulfide, and others) are widespread on the Earth surface, where they have produced geol. bodies distributed over a wide time slice. These communities are entirely sustained by gas-bearing cold fluids, coming to the surface from the upper crust, around which they grow. This kind of outgassing is not linked to volcanic activity and there is not hydrothermal influence. Cold outgassing is probably present on Mars, it has been obsd. on Ganymede, Europa, and other icy satellites (ice volcanism), and is theor. considered to be present on Titan. This possible extensive occurrence of outgassing sites on the planetary surface suggests that chemosynthesis may be an important player in the biol. of the Solar System. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  Abstract                 = {It is suggested that there are two distinct modes of dissociative recombination, which are called direct and indirect. The direct mechanism, first described by Bates, involves a single radiationless transition, whereas the indirect mode occurs through an intermediate Rydberg state of the molecule. The recombination rate for ground-state ions should decrease with increasing temperature for both processes, but the rate of decrease is faster for the indirect process. Complete calculations of the recombination rate do not seem possible yet, but it is shown that spectroscopic data can be used to give estimates of these rates. The method is illustrated by a partial calculation of the rate of direct recombination in nitric oxide.},

CO, CH4, Ar, and N2 were released in 3 or 4 distinct temp. ranges, each resulting from a different trapping mechanism: (1) 30-55 K, where the gas frozen on the water ice evaps.; (2) 135-155 K, where gas is squeezed out of the water ice during the transformation of amorphous ice to cubic ice; (3) 165-190 K, where gas and water are released simultaneously, probably by the evapn. of a clathrate hydrate and, occasionally, (4) 160-175 K, where deeply buried gas is released during the transformation of cubic ice to hexagonal ice. If the 3rd range is indeed due to clathrate formation, CO was found to form this compd. CO2 did not form a clathrate under the exptl. conditions. Excess H did not affect the occlusion of other gases. H itself was trapped only at 16 K. Ne was not trapped at 25 K. With cubic ice, the only trapping mechanism is freezing of gas on the ice surface.

C2H4 and C2H2 reached a temp.-dependent steady state, while C2H6 and C3H8 continued to rise linearly with time. The exptl. C2H4 column abundance in a photochem. steady state was extrapolated to the temps. expected in the CH4 photolysis layer on Titan. This, together with prior observations, make it possible to set a lower limit to the altitude of the top of Titan's aerosol layer, below which the C2H4 is protected from photolysis. This is 4.8 or 7.2 scale heights above the surface, for mean temps. in the photolysis layer of 130 and 160 K, resp. For 130 K, the C2H4 abundance above the inversion base agrees well with Gillett's observations, and leads to an aerosol cloud top coincident with the inversion base. In order to transport C2H4 to the cold (78 K) \"surface\" with a flux sufficiently large so that the rate of condensation equals the rate of prodn., an eddy diffusion coeff. at the surface of at least 102 cm2 s-1 is required. The exptl. results lead to an C2H2 abundance in a photochem. steady state which is .apprx.2 orders of magnitude smaller than the one suggested earlier. Since C3H8 is one of the major products, the possibility of observing it at 13.4 mm is suggested. [on SciFinder (R)]},

A theoretical model has been developed that allows the use of known prior information about the value of the measurand (activity), together with the experimental value determined through the measurement. The model has been applied to data of the Inter-laboratory Proficiency Test organised periodically among Spanish environmental radioactivity laboratories that are producing the radiochemical results for the Spanish radioactive monitoring network. A global improvement of laboratories performance is produced when this prior information is taken into account. The prior information used in this methodology is an interval within which the activity is known to be contained, but it could be extended to any other experimental quantity with a different type of prior information available.},

  Abstract                 = {A time-dependent microphys. model is used to study the evolution of ethane ice clouds in Titan's atm. The model simulates nucleation, condensational growth, evapn., coagulation, and transport of particles. For a crit. satn. of 1.15 (a lower limit, detd. by lab. expts.), we find that ethane clouds can be sustained between altitudes of 8 and 50 km. Growth due to coalescence is inefficient, limiting the peak in the size distribution (by no.) to 10 mm. These clouds vary with a period of about 20 days. This periodicity disappears for higher crit. satn. values where clouds remain subvisible. Rainout of ethane due to methane cloud formation raises the altitude of the ethane cloud bottom to near the tropopause and may eliminate ethane clouds entirely if methane cloud formation occurs up to 30 km. However, clouds formed above the troposphere from other gases in Titan's atm. could be sustained even with rainout up to 30 km. Although the optical depth of ethane clouds above 20 km is typically low, short-lived clouds with optical depths of order 0.1-1 can be created sporadically by dynamically driven atm. cooling. Ethane cloud particles larger than 25 mm can fall to the surface before total evapn. However, ethane clouds remain only a small sink for tholin particles. At the peak of their cycle, the optical depth of ethane clouds could be comparable to that of tholin in the near-IR, resulting in a 5% increase in Titan's albedo for wavelengths between 1 and 2 mm. A no. of factors limit our ability to predict the ethane cloud properties. These factors include the mixing time in the troposphere, the crit. satn. ratio for ethane ice, the existence of a surface reservoir of ethane, the magnitude and timing of dynamically driven temp. perturbations, and the abundance and life cycle of methane clouds.

This is the first systematic study of these clusters. Geometries are reported for the lowest energy states at this level of theory. Linear structures tend to be the global minima for clusters containing one or two nitrogen atoms, and patterns in the electronic structure of these clusters are reported. More complex branched structures lie close in energy to the linear conformations and, for clusters greater than six atoms and containing three or more nitrogen atoms, these branched structures are the minimum energy conformers. Comparisons are made with pure carbon and silicon-carbon clusters.},

  Abstract                 = {It has been observed that the first pages of a table of common logarithms show more wear than do the last pages, indicating that more used numbers begin with the digit 1 than with the digit 9. A compilation of some 20,000 first digits taken from widely divergent sources shows that there is a logarithmic distribution of first digits when the numbers are composed of four or more digits. An analysis of the numbers from different sources shows that the numbers taken from unrelated subjects, such as a group of newspaper items, show a much better agreement with a logarithmic distribution than do numbers from mathematical tabulations or other formal data. There is here the peculiar fact that numbers that individually are without relationship are, when considered in large groups, in good agreement with a distribution law-hence the name "Anomalous Numbers." A further analysis of the data shows a strong tendency for bodies of numerical data to fall into geometric series. If the series is made up of numbers containing three or more digits the first digits form a logarithmic series. If the numbers contain only single digits the geometric relation still holds but the simple logarithmic relation no longer applies. An equation is given showing the frequencies of first digits in the different orders of numbers 1 to 10, 10 to 100, etc. The equation also gives the frequency of digits in the second, third... place of a multi-digit number, and it is shown that the same law applies to reciprocals. There are many instances showing that the geometric series, or the logarithmic law, has long been recognized as a common phenomenon in factual literature and in the ordinary affairs of life. The wire gauge and drill gauge of the mechanic, the magnitude scale of the astronomer and the sensory response curves of the psychologist are all particular examples of a relationship that seems to extend to all human affairs. The Law of Anomalous Numbers is thus a general probability law of widespread application.},

It is of great importance to det. precisely and to model its abundance profile to be able to fully understand the chem. of these environments. To achieve this task 1 needs the knowledge of the absorption coeff. in IR and UV which are complementary wavelength ranges for studying atms. The mid-UV absorption coeff. is of special importance when trying to model the photo-dissocn. of C2H2 because of the rise of the solar flux >200 nm. The authors have previously shown that the most recent data on acetylene cross sections had to be taken with caution because of the presence of acetone bands in the published spectra. Also, abs. absorption coeff. of C2H2 is poorly known >200 nm. Consequently, the authors have measured C2H2 absorption coeff. in the 185-235 nm range, at 295 and 173 K. The authors present the obtained results, putting a special emphasis on their temp. dependence. Then, the authors discuss the implications of those results on theor. photochem. modeling and on future observations of methane rich atms. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  Abstract                 = {For several years now, an exptl. simulation of Titan's atm. has been on going at LISA. A cold plasma is established in a gas mixt. representative of the atm. of the satellite. In these expts., more than 70 org. compds. have been identified, including the first identification in this type of exptl. simulation of C4N2 already detected in its solid form on Titan, which suggests that the setup correctly mimics the chem. of Titan's atm. We have carried out the first exptl. simulation including O-contg. compds. in order to study the influence of the presence of CO on the chem. behavior of Titan's atm. With the help of gas chromatog.-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and IR spectroscopy (IRS) we can thus det. which minor species still undetected in Titan's atm. are likely to be present and understand the complex chem. of the atm. of this satellite. Surprisingly we have identified unpredicted O-contg. gaseous compds., mainly ethylene oxide (also named oxirane, C2H4O). This mol. has been obsd. in the interstellar medium by observation in the millimeter region (Astrophys. J. 489 (1997) 553; Astron. Astrophys. 337 (1998) 275). On the contrary, the predicted O-compds. (formaldehyde and methanol) have not been identified in this expt. Furthermore, we have identified NH3 in the gaseous products with an initial mixt. of N2 (98%) and CH4 (2%). The paper describes the exptl. device used in this work, in particular the IRS and GC-MS techniques. We also comment the results related to the detection of the O-contg. compds. and NH3 and their implications on our knowledge of the chem. of Titan's atm. and on the retrieval of the future Titan data expected from Cassini-Huygens.

  Abstract                 = {During the 1981 Voyager encounter, Titan's stratosphere exhibited a large thermal asymmetry, with high northern latitudes being colder than comparable southern latitudes. Given the short radiative time constant, this asymmetry would not be expected at the season of the Voyager observations (spring equinox), if the infrared and solar opacity sources were distributed symmetrically. We have investigated the radiative budget of Titan's stratosphere, using two selections of Voyager IRIS spectra recorded at symmetric northern and southern latitudes. In the region 0.1-1 mbar, temperatures are 7 K colder at 50[degree sign]N than at 53[degree sign]S and the difference reaches ~13 K at 5 mbar. On the other hand, the northern region is strongly enriched in nitriles and hydrocarbons, and the haze optical depth derived from the continuum emission between 8 and 15 [mu]m is twice as large as in the south. Cooling rate profiles have been computed at the two locations, using the gas and haze abundances derived from the IRIS measurements. We find that, despite lower temperatures, the cooling rate profiles in the pressure range 0.15-5 mbar are 20 to 40% larger in the north than in the south, because of the enhanced concentrations of infrared radiators. Because the northern hemisphere appears darker than the southern one in the Voyager images, enhanced solar heating is also expected to take place at 50[degree sign]N. Solar heating rate profiles have been calculated, with two different assumptions on the origin of the hemispheric asymmetry. In the most likely case where it results from a variation in the absorbance of the haze material, the heating rates are found to be 12-15% larger at the northern location than at the southern one, a smaller increase than that in the cooling rates. If the lower albedo in the north results from an increase in the particle number density, a 55 to 75% difference is found for the pressure range 0.15-5 mbar, thus larger than that calculated for the cooling rates. Considering the uncertainties in the haze model, dynamical heat transport may significantly contribute to the meridional temperature gradients observed in the stratosphere. On the other hand, the latitudinal variation in gas and haze composition may be sufficient to explain the entire temperature asymmetry observed, without invoking a lag in the thermal response of the atmosphere due to dynamical inertia.},

  Abstract                 = {Attenuation of radio signals from absorption in Titan's atm. is computed for various radio ray path geometries applicable to the Huygens Probe Relay Link (PRL). The absence of strong radio absorbers such as ammonia or water in Titan's neutral atm. results in rather weak attenuation at the S-band wavelengths used for Huygens at l = 14.7 cm (f = 2040 MHz) and l = 14.3 cm (f = 2098 MHz). Attenuation in the neutral atm. is assumed to arise mainly (.simeq. 80%) from collision-induced absorption by mol. nitrogen. The remaining 20% is attributed to the same absorption process but via collisions of N2 with CH4. Defocusing losses due to atm. refraction, which is quite severe for radio occultation conditions, is negligible for the geometry applicable to the Huygens PRL. Tropospheric methane clouds are also not expected to have any measurable effect on the PRL. If the fractional ionization in the lower atm. is significantly enhanced by cosmic rays, absorption by free electron could become the dominant source of S-band attenuation. The predicted attenuation loss for the nominal baseline link at Probe touchdown (altitude z0 = 0 km; Probe Aspect Angle PAA = 45 Deg) is .simeq.-0.02 dB. If the cosmic ray source of ionization is detd. to be unimportant, the attenuation at this PAA will be more like -0.004 dB. Finally, applying these attenuation calcns. to the 15 GHz signal of the Huygens Radar Altimeter, it is found that the two-way (up and down ray path) vertical attenuation will not exceed -0.281 dB.

with acetic and propanoic acid respectively. Even more promising in the context of interstellar
synthesis are our results that demonstrate the corresponding production of the protonated
amino acids from analogous reactions with protonated hydroxylamine. The striking specificity
of these syntheses for the β-isomer of alanine suggests that the amino acids of CI (Carbonaceous
Ivona) chondrite meteorites are products of interstellar chemistry and supports the hypothesis
that these meteorites are of cometary origin.},

Emphasis is given to the use of flow-tube mass spectrometry in measurements of the dependence of ion reactivity on temperature, kinetic energy and internal energy. Achievements in our understanding of basic reaction types are discussed, including electron-transfer, proton-transfer, metal, and organometallic ion reactions and electron-ion recombination. A review is included of fullerene-ion chemistry that has been a focus in the laboratory of the author at York University over the last 10 years.

H (LH2)-cooled nuclear thermal rocket (NTR) engines makes them ideal for upper stage applications to difficult robotic planetary science missions. A small 15 thousand pound force (klbf) NTR engine using a U-Zr-Nb ternary carbide fuel (Isp .apprx.960 s at .apprx.3025 K) developed in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) is examd. and its use on an expendable injection stage provides major increases in payload delivered to the outer planets (Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto). Using a single Titan IV-class launch vehicle, with a lift capability to low Earth orbit (LEO) of .apprx.20 metric tons (t), an expendable NTR upper stage can inject 2 Pluto Fast Flyby spacecraft (PFF/SC) plus support equipment--combined mass of .apprx.508 kg--on high energy, 6.5-9.2 yr direct trajectory missions to Pluto. A conventional chem. propulsion mission would use a liq. O (LOX)/LH2 Centaur upper stage and 2 solid rocket kick motors to inject a single PFF/SC on the same Titan IV launch vehicle. For follow on Pluto missions, the NTR injection stage would use a Jupiter gravity assist (JGA) maneuver to launch a LOX/liq. methane (CH4) capture stage (Isp .apprx.375 s) and a Pluto orbiter spacecraft weighing between .apprx.167-312 kg, with chem. propulsion, a Pluto orbiter mission is not a viable option because of inadequate delivered mass. Using a standardized NTR injection stage and the same single Titan IV launch scenario, direct flight (no gravity assist) orbiter missions to Saturn, Uranus and Neptune are also enabled with transit times of 2.3, 6.6, and 12.6 yr, resp. Injected mass includes a storable, N tetroxide/monomethyl hydrazine (N2O4/MMH) capture stage (Isp .apprx.330 s) and orbiter payloads 340 to 820% larger than that achievable using a LOX/LH2-fueled injection stage. The paper discusses NTR technol. and mission characteristics, shows NTR stage and payload accommodations within the 26.2 m long Titan IV payload fairing, and discusses NTR stage performance as a function of assumed cryogenic tank technol.

This method of simulation has the advantage of producing short-duration, high-temp. plasmas free from electrode contamination. The laser-induced plasma discharges in air accurately simulate terrestrial lightning and can be expected to simulate lightning spectra in other planetary atmospheres. Spectra from 240 to 880 nm are presented for simulated lightning in the atmospheres of Venus, Earth, Jupiter, and Titan. The spectra of lightning on the other giant planets are expected to be similar to that ot Jupiter because the atmospheres of these planets are composed mainly of H and He. The spectra of Venus and Titan show substantial amts. of radiation due to the presence of C atoms and ions and show CN Violet radiation. Although small amts. of CH4 and NH3 are present in the Jovian atm., only emission from H and He was obsd. Most difference in the spectra can be understood in terms of the elemental ratios of the gas mixts. Consequently, observations of the spectra of lightning on other planets should provide in situ ests. of the atm. and aerosol compn. in the cloud layers in which lightning is occurring. In particular, the detection of inert gases such as He should be possible and the relative abundance of these gases compared to major constituents might be detd. [on SciFinder (R)]},

The agreement with current exptl. data has been obtained by adjusting the classical, multipole induced dipolar components by adding semiempirical quantum corrections. A Q6 induction term, never considered before, is included. With the set of temp.-independent parameters derived from fitting the exptl. data, the model reproduces recent lab. measurements within 124-300 K temp. and the 10-600 cm-1 frequency range, within few percent root mean square. The method provides reliable temp. dependence of the absorption coeff. as a function of frequency at temps. as low as 70 K, which are much lower than those at which lab. measurements are taken.

We discuss the rates of reactions and their uncertainties. Comparisons with experimental data show that gas-phase rate uncertainties do not explain the disagreements at higher pressures ($>$30 mTorr). We also find that electron impact dissociation reactions of dominant neutrals are the largest sources of uncertainties. HF kinetics are also found to be critical in determining radical and feedstock gas densities. Relative ion densities are uncertain due to poor understanding of charge transfer mechanisms.},

Line intensities and self-broadening coeffs. derived from a previous anal. made by the authors' group for 255 lines in the region of the 3n2 band of 12CH3D at 1.55 mm were recently reported.

A set of Fourier transform spectra recorded at Kitt Peak National Observatory with pressures of 100, 250 and 500 torr for H2 and N2, and 600 torr for He, was used for this study. Data redn. was performed using a nonlinear least-squares fitting multispectrum program developed for this purpose.

  Abstract                 = {Comparison of plasma population kinetics codes, which has become an important tool for their testing and verification, was the subject of the third Non-LTE Code Comparison Workshop held at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in December 2003. The motivations for the workshop are presented here, together with its technical organization. The cases studied range from carbon to gold, and include both steady-state and time-dependent calculations. The set of results represents the current capabilities in kinetics modeling, and illustrates the effectiveness of this workshop approach to code comparisons. It was found that good agreement between codes and with experiments is observed near closed shells, but significant differences exist otherwise, or when density effects are important. On a more general level, we discuss how to meaningfully compare kinetics data. We conclude with plans for the next workshop and for a kinetics database.},

The "recommended" temperature profile derived by Lellouch /1/, the aerosol distribution from McKay /2/ and their properties from Khare /3/, and an atmospheric composition from the new photochemical model of Toublanc /4/ are used in the framework of plane parallel geometry to compute all processes that occur in the atmosphere. The solar flux at each level in the atmosphere in the wavelength range 10-1000 nm is estimated. This paper improves 2D models including multiple scattering by molecules and aerosols in a 3D model. Assuming spherical symmetry, the atmosphere is divided into spherical layers of equal optical depth [tau] = 0.01. The solar flux is represented by 105-106 photons cm-2. The absorption and diffusion by aerosols and gases is treated exactly.},

  Abstract                 = {The global hydrogen Lyman α, helium (584 angstroms), and molecular hydrogen band emissions from Saturn are qualitatively similar to those of Jupiter, but the Saturn observations emphasize that the H$_{2}$ band excitation mechanism is closely related to the solar flux. Auroras occur near 80° latitude, suggesting Earth-like magnetotail activity, quite different from the dominant Io plasma torus mechanism at Jupiter. No ion emissions have been detected from the magnetosphere of Saturn, but the rings have a hydrogen atmosphere; atomic hydrogen is also present in a torus between 8 and 25 Saturn radii. Nitrogen emission excited by particles has been detected in the Titan dayglow and bright limb scans. Enhancement of the nitrogen emission is observed in the region of interaction between Titan's atmosphere and the corotating plasma in Saturn's plasmasphere. No particle-excited emission has been detected from the dark atmosphere of Titan. The absorption profile of the atmosphere determined by the solar occultation experiment, combined with constraints from the dayglow observations and temperature information, indicate that N$_{2}$ is the dominant species. A double layer structure has been detected above Titan's limb. One of the layers may be related to visible layers in the images of Titan.},

  Abstract                 = {Atm. conditions on Saturn's largest satellite, Titan, allow the possibility that it could possess a methane condensation and pptn. cycle with many similarities to Earth's hydrol. cycle. Detailed imaging studies of Titan have hitherto shown no direct evidence for tropospheric condensation clouds, although there has been indirect spectroscopic evidence for transient clouds. Here we report images and spectra of Titan that show clearly transient clouds, concd. near the south pole, which is currently near the point of max. solar heating. The discovery of these clouds demonstrates the existence of condensation and localized moist convection in Titan's atm. Their location suggests that methane cloud formation is controlled seasonally by small variations in surface temp., and that the clouds will move from the south to the north pole on a 15-yr timescale.

  Abstract                 = {{The gas-phase photodissociation dynamics of methane after excitation at the Lyman-alpha wavelength (121.6 nm) was investigated under collision-free conditions at room temperature. Narrow-band tunable Lyman-cr laser radiation was generated by the resonant third-order sum-difference frequency conversion of pulsed-dye laser radiation and used both to photodissociate the parent molecules and to detect the photolytically produced hydrogen atoms via (2p(2)P<--1s(2)S) laser-induced fluorescence. H atom Doppler profiles were recorded and the absolute quantum yield for H atom formation, Phi(H) = (0.47 +/- 0.11), was determined by means of a photolytic calibration method where the Lyman-alpha photolysis of H2O was used as a reference source of well-defined H atom concentrations, This value will be used in combination with previous results from H-2 and CH yield measurements to estimate the relative importance of the different product pathways in the CH4 photodissociation.}},

HCN oligomers and polymers are readily formed at room temp. and react with water to produce polypeptides and a-amino acids or undergo pyrolysis to produce nitrogen heterocycles. ESR (ESR) spectroscopy shows that HCN polymer mixts. contain a significant amt. of long-lived org. free radicals that are primarily carbon-based. For comparison, we have also examd. samples of tholins produced from exptl. analogs of Titan aerosols, which has been shown by trace org. anal. to consist partly of HCN polymer. The \"Titan tholin\" exhibits at least two ESR signals that can be assigned to nitrogen- and carbon-centered radicals, although heating the sample eliminates the nitrogen centers and increases the signal from the carbon centers. This result suggests that the nitrogen-centered radicals may be thermodynamically less stable, but are kinetically trapped during the spark-discharge reactions that produce tholins from mixts. of gases such as methane and nitrogen. The results strongly support previous proposals of free radical mechanisms for HCN polymn. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  Abstract                 = {Non-linear regression (NLR) analysis in chemometric applications is the main subject of the paper. The following novel items of NLR procedure are reported. The modification of gradient method is considered. For inversion of the Fisher matrix the recurrence algorithm based on the matrix exponential is used. A new method of sequential Bayesian estimation allows processing of the data successively for every response. Each data set is fitted individually, but taking into account the information about common parameters estimated on previous data sets. A posterior Bayesian distribution is built after every set processing. A new method of confidence estimation is suggested. Unlike bootstrap, not initial data but parameter estimates are simulated. This method has the same accuracy as bootstrap but is about 1000 times faster. A new coefficient of non-linearity is introduced. It is calculated by the Monte Carlo procedure and accounts for the model structure as well as the experimental design features. All new ideas were implemented in the software FITTER, a new Excel Add-In. Its main capabilities are reported. The paper is illustrated with a number of practical examples in DSC, TMA and TGA data analysis. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {A review with 79 refs. Titan, the main satellite of Saturn, has been obsd. by remote sensing for many years, both from interplanetary probes (Pioneer and Voyager's flybys) and from the Earth. Its N2 atmosphere, contg. a small fraction of CH4 (~2%), with T ~ 90 K and P ~ 1.5 bar at the ground level, is irradiated by solar UV photons and deeply bombarded by energetic particles, i.e. Saturn magnetospheric electrons and protons, interplanetary electrons and cosmic rays. The resulting energy deposition, which takes place mainly below 1000 km, initiates chem. reactions which yield gaseous hydrocarbons and nitriles and, through polymn. processes, solid aerosol particles which grow by coagulation and settle down to the ground. At the present time, photochem. models strongly require the results of specific lab. studies. Chem. rate consts. are not well known at low temps., charged-particle-induced reactions are difficult to model and lab. simulations of atm. processes are therefore of great interest. Moreover, the synthesis of org. compds. which have not been detected to date provides valuable information for future observations. The origin and chem. compn. of aerosols depend on the nature of chem. and energy sources. Their prodn. from gaseous species may be monitored in lab. chambers and their optical or microphys. properties compared to those deduced from the observations of Titan's atm. The development of simulation chambers of Titan's extreme conditions is necessary for a better understanding of past and future observations. Space probes will sound Titan's atm. by remote sensing and in situ anal. in the near future (Cassini-Huygens mission). It appears necessary, as a preliminary step, to test on-board expts. in such chambers, and as a final step, when new space data have been acquired, to use them for more general scientific purposes.

  Abstract                 = {A review with 31 refs. gives an overview of the basic characteristics in terms of structure and atm. of the planets and their satellites. This is adapted from a plenary lecture delivered at the 5th International Conference on Thermodn. of Solns. of Non-Electrolites in Oporto, Portugal in 1992. The birth of modern science is linked to the first systematic observations of the solar system by Galileo in the 17th century. His first important publication, Sidereus Nuncius (1610), had a tremendous impact on fellow scientists as well as on painters and writers. This lecture attempts to draw a parallel between those pioneering observations and the current spate of space missions to explore the solar system. Although most of the direct measurements are carried out through spectroscopic techniques, the modeling of the structure of the planets (including, when relevant, their atmospheres) is based on kinetics and thermodn. In the 1960's, Venus provided the first example of a thermodn. model applied to a planet. Among the most interesting bodies in the solar system are Titan (a satellite of Saturn) and Triton (a satellite of Neptune). Both have nitrogen atmospheres, but whereas Triton exhibits a frozen surface, with polar ice caps and geysers, the (invisible) surface of Titan should be extensively covered by an ocean of liq. ethane and methane. This is the realm of thermodn. of simple mols. at cryogenic temps. Some recent phase equil. and calorimetric measurements on the relevant systems are helping to form a coherent picture of the structure and atm. of these planets, in anticipation of the forthcoming (1996) Cassini mission. Given the overwhelming presence of the Sun, it is rarely possible to develop a feasible model for the atmospheres of the various planets on the basis of classical thermodn. alone. What happens is largely detd. by a tug-of-war between photochem. (driven by the Sun) and thermodn. (driven by the interior heat of the planets). [on SciFinder (R)]},

  Abstract                 = {This paper surveys issues associated with the statistical calibration of physics-based computer simulators. Even in solidly physics-based models there are usually a number of parameters that are suitable targets for calibration. Statistical calibration means refining the prior distributions of such uncertain parameters based on matching some simulation outputs with data, as opposed to the practice of "tuning" or point estimation that is commonly called calibration in non-statistical contexts. Older methods for statistical calibration are reviewed before turning to recent work in which the calibration problem is embedded in a Gaussian process model. In procedures of this type, parameter estimation is carried out simultaneously with the estimation of the relationship between the calibrated simulator and truth.},

A similar effect was obsd. for the reaction for CH + CH4 and CH + C2H6 with a max. rate at 40 K. The results were compared with earlier studies if available and the nature of possible products was discussed although the method used here did not enable their detection.

The major objectives of the study were (1) to compare in blind experiments the results of different techniques of measuring j(NO2) and j(O1 D) under identical and well-defined experimental conditions, (2) to compare results of blind theoretical modeling of j(NO2) and j(O1 D) expected at the experimental site using several current models, (3) to compare the experimental and model results for the j values, (4) to compare the measured and modeled downwelling actinic flux, and (5) on the basis of the results, make recommendations for the choices between alternative quantum yield and cross-section data. The findings of the IPMMI experiment are described in a series of papers in this issue [e.g., Shetter et al., 2003; Bais et al., 2003], and the overall conclusions are summarized here. Actinic fluxes can be measured to accuracies of â¼5% and can be estimated with radiative transfer models to â¼10%. Photolysis rate coefficients can be measured and modeled with accuracies of â¼10% for high-sun, clear-sky, and low-aerosol loadings. Comparisons between chemical actinometers and spectroradiometers favor more recent, larger cross-section and quantum yield values for NO2 and O3.},

Exptl. results and theor. modeling studies suggest that the org. chem. of the satellite is dominated by 2 atm. processes: photochem. and energetic particle bombardment. Photochem. reactions of CH4 in the upper atm. can account for the presence of C2 hydrocarbons. Reactions initiated in various levels of the atm. by cosmic ray, Saturn wind, and solar-wind particle bombardment of a CH4-N2 atm. mixt. can account for the UV-visible absorbing stratospheric haze, the reddish appearance of the satellite, and some of the C2 hydrocarbons. In the lower atm., photochem. processes will be important if surface temps. are sufficiently high for gaseous NH3 and CH4; if 0.1% of the incident UV light from 1600-2270 .ANG. reaches the lower atm., these reactions will be capable of producing org. matter at a rate comparable to or higher than that resulting from particle-initiated reactions. Elec. discharges are highly improbable on Titan; if they occurred at all, they would be restricted to the lower atm. and clouds. Their yield of org. matter might approach that of hot H atom reactions if the conversion of solar to elec. discharge energy on Titan was as efficient as that on earth. [on SciFinder (R)]},

This instrument utilizes a tunable filter element that was used within the 500- to 1050-nm range, coupled to a CCD camera system. The images were taken with the Mount Wilson 2.54-m (100 in.) Hooker telescope, which is equipped with a natural guide star adaptive optics system. We obsd. Titan at 830 and 890 nm and at a series of wavelengths across the 940-nm window in Titan's atm. where the methane opacity is relatively low. We detd. the abs. reflectivity (I/F) of Titan and fit the values at 940 nm to a Minnaert function at Titan's equator and at -30 Deg latitude (closer to the subsolar point) and obtained av. values for the Minnaert limb-darkening slope, k, of 0.661 +- 0.007 and 0.775 +- 0.018, resp. Comparison with models suggests that the equatorial value of k is consistent with rain removal of haze in the lower atm. The higher value of k at -30 Deg is consistent with the southern hemisphere being brighter than the equator. However, the fits are not unique. The data and models at 890 are consistent with no limb brightening or darkening at this wavelength either at the equator or at -30 Deg. [on SciFinder (R)]},

If Titan's troposphere has a lower eddy diffusion coeff. than that obsd. for Earth, even smaller values of the sticking coeff. (e.g., approx. 10-6) would be required.

  Abstract                 = {The uniformity can be utilized as a measure for comparing factorial designs. Fang and Mukerjee (Biometrika 87 (2000) 193-198) and Fang et al. (in: K.T. Fang, F.J. Hickernell, H. Niederreiter (Eds.), Monte Carlo and Quasi-Monte Carlo Methods 2000, Springer, Berlin, 2002) found links among uniformity in terms of some non-uniformity measures, orthogonality and aberration for regular symmetric factorials. In this paper we extend their results to asymmetric factorials by considering a so-called wrap-around L2-discrepancy to evaluate the uniformity of factorials. Furthermore, a lower bound of wrap-around L2-discrepancy is obtained for asymmetric factorials and two new ways of construction of factorial designs with mixed levels are proposed.},

  Abstract                 = {Collisional neutralization of protonated acetonitrile (6+) generates (E)- and (Z)-1-azapropen-2-yl radicals, CH3CNH, (3 and 4, respectively) that represent the kinetically and thermodynamically forbidden adducts of hydrogen atoms to acetonitrile. Radicals 3 and 4 are formed with an excess of internal energy due to FranckCondon effects and rapidly dissociate by loss of the imine hydrogen atom, a methyl hydrogen, and by CH3---CNH bond cleavage. The branching ratios for the loss of the imine hydrogen (H or D) and methyl group (CH3 or CD3) were determined for CH3CNH, CD3CNH, CH3CND, and CD3CND as 70/30, 66/34, 43/57, and 61/39, respectively. Ab initio calculations with coupled clusters with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations/aug-cc-pVTZ predict the loss of the imine hydrogen from 4 to have the lowest transition-state energy. The calculated branching ratios that were based on RiceRamspergerKasselMarcus (RRKM) unimolecular rate constants agreed with the mass spectrometric data within experimental accuracy. However, the loss of the methyl hydrogen is predicted by RRKM to be incompetitive (<0.1%) on the ground doublet electronic states of 3 and 4. The observed fraction (10%) is presumed to occur from an excited electronic state.},

  Abstract                 = {When retrieving atmospheric parameters from radiance spectra, the forward modelling of radiative transfer through the Earth's atmosphere plays a key role, since inappropriate modelling directly maps on to the retrieved state parameters. In the context of pre-launch activities of the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) experiment, which is a high resolution limb emission sounder for measurement of atmospheric composition and temperature, five scientific groups intercompared their forward models within the framework of the Advanced MIPAS Level 2 Data Analysis (AMIL2DA) project. These forward models have been developed, or, in certain respects, adapted in order to be used as part of the groups' MIPAS data processing. The following functionalities have been assessed: the calculation of line strengths including non-local thermodynamic equilibrium, the evaluation of the spectral line shape, application of chi-factors and semi-empirical continua, the interpolation of pre-tabulated absorption cross sections in pressure and temperature, line coupling, atmospheric ray tracing, the integration of the radiative transfer equation through an inhomogeneous atmosphere, the convolution of monochromatic spectra with an instrument line shape function, and the integration of the incoming radiances over the instrument field of view.},

  Abstract                 = {Many expts. have already been carried out to simulate org. chem. on Titan, the largest satellite of Saturn. They can provide fruitful information on the nature of minor org. constituents likely to be present in Titan's atm., both in gas and aerosol phases. Indeed, all the org. compds. but one already detected in Titan's atm. have been identified in simulation expts. The exception, C4N2, as well as other compds. expected in Titan from theor. modeling, such as other N-orgs., and polyynes, first of all C6H2, have never been detected in exptl. simulation thus far. All these compds. are thermally unstable, and the temp. conditions used during the simulation expts. were not appropriate. We have recently started a new program of simulation expts. with temp. conditions close to that of Titan's environment. It also uses dedicated anal. techniques and procedures compatible with the anal. of orgs. only stable at low temps., as well solid products of low stability in the presence of O2 and H2O. Spark discharge of N2-CH4 gas mixts. was carried out at low temp. in the range 100-150 K. Products were analyzed by FTIR, GC, and GC-MS techniques. GC-peaks were identified by their mass spectrum, and, in most cases, by comparison of the retention time and mass spectrum with std. ones. In Titan simulation expts., C6H2 and HC5N were detected. Their abundance is a few percent relative to C4H2 and HC3N, resp. Preliminary data on the solid products indicate an elemental compn. corresponding to (H11C11N)n. These results open new prospects in the modeling of Titan's haze making. [on SciFinder (R)]},

This atm. also partly consists of hazes and aerosol particles which shroud the surface of this satellite, giving it a reddish appearance. The aerosols obsd. in Titan's atm. are thought to be synthesized at high altitudes (>300 km) and fall to the surface. Varying with temp. profiles, condensation phenomena take place in the lower atm., about 100 km below. These solid particles, often called \"tholins\", have been currently investigated for many years by lab. scientists and physics modelers. This paper assesses past research and results in different fields (elemental compn., optical consts., pyrolysis, particle size), highlighting interests and questions aroused by these studies.

Complementary ab initio calculations of selected portions of the potential energy surfaces for the various components of the T-1(2) and T-3(2) excited states arising from the 3sa(1)<-- 1t(2) electron promotion are presented in the case of CH4. The form of the H atom recoil velocity distribution arising in the 121.6 nm photolysis of CH4 is rationalised in terms of initial excitation to both the 2(1)A' and 1(1)A{''} excited states (Jahn-Teller components of the degenerate T-1(2) state), followed by a range of decay mechanisms. CH4(2(1)A') molecules can decay adiabatically, via sequential extension of first one, then a second, C-H bond with eventual formation of two H atoms and CH2((a) over tilde (1)A(1)) products, or after internal conversion (IC) to the ground state. The H+CH3((X) over tilde) products resulting from the IC process display a recoil velocity distribution characterised by an anisotropy parameter beta similar to +2, implying that the fragmentation involves irreversible extension of the C-H bond along which the transition dipole points at the instant of photon absorption. Fragmentation of CH4(1(1)A{''}) molecules to H+CH3((X) over tilde) products proceeds via intersystem crossing to the lowest (3)A' potential energy surface. The recoil anisotropy of these products (beta similar to -0.45) implies that this radiationless process also occurs on a timescale that is rapid compared to the parent rotational period. Both single H-C bond fission channels may yield CH3((X) over tilde) products with such high levels of internal excitation that they are unstable with respect to further unimolecular decay; any H atoms that result from this secondary decay must contribute to the observed yield of slow H atoms with beta similar to0. All H atoms resulting from Lyman-alpha photolysis of both SiH4 and GeH4 have (low) kinetic energies and little or no recoil anisotropy, compatible with their being formed via three body fragmentation to, primarily, H+H+SiH2/GeH2((X) over tilde (1)A(1)) products. Faster H atoms are evident in the total kinetic energy release (TKER) spectra obtained following 157.6 nm photoexcitation of SiH4, but the power dependence of this fast H atom signal implies that these arise as a result of a two photon process involving initial formation of SiH2+H-2 products and subsequent photolysis of the nascent silylene fragments.}},

  Abstract                 = {The ubiquity of mol. material in the universe, from hydrogen to complex org. matter, is the result of intermixed physicochem. processes that have occurred throughout history. In particular, the gas/solid/gas phase transformation cycle plays a key role in chem. evolution of org. matter from the interstellar medium to planetary systems. This paper focuses on two examples that are representative of the diversity of environments where such transformations occur in the Solar System: (1) the photolytic evolution from gaseous to solid material in methane contg. planetary atmospheres and (2) the degrdn. of high mol. wt. compds. into gas phase mols. in comets. We are currently developing two programs which couple exptl. and theor. studies. The aim of this research is to provide data necessary to build models in order to better understand (1) the photochem. evolution of Titan's atm., through a lab. program to det. quant. spectroscopic data on long carbon chain mols. (polyynes) obtained in the SCOOP program (French acronym for Spectroscopy of Org. Compds. Oriented for Planetol.), and (2) the extended sources in comets, through a lab. program of quant. studies of photochem. and thermal degrdn. processes on relevant polymers (e.g., Polyoxymethylene) by the SEMAPhOrE Cometaire program (French acronym for Exptl. Simulation and Modeling Applied to Org. Chem. in Cometary Environment). We report here studies of polyoxymethylene degrdn. that suggest this is a plausible explanation for the formaldehyde extended sources obsd. in several comets. [on SciFinder (R)]},

In addn. to the collision-induced gaseous absorption, the radiative transfer model includes scattering and absorption by stratospheric haze particles and potential tropospheric condensation clouds.

We find the following results: (1) The observations are best fit with significant methane supersatn. in the troposphere (up to a factor of two) and no condensation cloud present. (2) If a condensation cloud is present we find that it must have an optical depth less than 0.7 with a mean particle radius of about 50 mm and be located very near the min. temp. level around 40 km, significantly higher than the expected condensation level.

  Abstract                 = {We have derived temps. at the tropopause and near the surface of Titan from a set of radiance measurements made by the Voyager IRIS instrument at 300 and 510 cm-1 (33.3 and 19.6 mm). At 510 cm-1, Titan's atm. is relatively transparent and the surface contribution to the measured radiance is approx. 60%. On the other hand, the 300 cm-1 radiance is mostly sensitive to the tropopause temp., as well as to the degree of methane supersatn. in the upper troposphere. The retrievals are based on a simple inversion scheme of the radiative transfer equation and rely on a model of the atm. opacity derived by Courtin et al. (Icarus 114 (1995) 144). Although the longitude-latitude coverage afforded by the IRIS dataset is severely limited, as is also the surface area covered by the IRIS footprints (.apprx.22%), we were able to ext. longitudinal and latitudinal profiles of the tropopause and near-surface (brightness) temps. We find that the zonal distributions of the tropopause and near-surface temps. are fairly homogeneous. The meridional distribution of the tropopause temp. shows only a slight increase (.apprx.1 K) from -60 Deg to 60 Deg. On the other hand, the surface brightness temp. varies significantly and sym. from equator to pole (2.5-3.2 K). Less then one-third of this decrease can potentially be attributed to meridional variations of the stratospheric thermal structure. This confirms earlier results obtained from more limited selections of the IRIS data, both in terms of symmetry and amplitude. The role that could be played by meridional variations of the supersatd. distribution of methane is explored, although no definite answer can be derived in this respect. A significant variation of the bulk temp. gradient between the surface and the tropopause is suggested, the troposphere at high latitudes appearing more stable with respect to moist convection than in the equatorial regions. Finally, a very tentative result concerns an area where the near-surface (brightness) temp. shows a significant differential with respect to the extrapolation of the latitudinal distribution of surface temps. Possible interpretations of this differential include: a low emissivity surface feature with 25% contrast, an actual surface cold spot (with a temp. contrast of .apprx.3 K), a transient tropospheric cloud of optical thickness t.apprx.1, or an elevated area of height .apprx.5 km. Further high spatial resoln. data, esp. those that will be collected by the Cassini orbital mission, will be necessary to discriminate between the various possibilities. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  Abstract                 = {We have analyzed data recorded by the Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) aboard the Cassini spacecraft during the Titan flybys T0-T10 (July 2004-January 2006). The spectra characterize various regions on Titan from 70° S to 70° N with a variety of emission angles. We study the molecular signatures observed in the mid-infrared CIRS detector arrays (FP3 and FP4, covering roughly the 600-1500 cm-1 spectral range with apodized resolutions of 2.54 or 0.53 cm-1). The composite spectrum shows several molecular signatures: hydrocarbons, nitriles and CO2. A firm detection of benzene (C6H6) is provided by CIRS at levels of about 3.5×10-9 around 70° N. We have used temperature profiles retrieved from the inversion of the emission observed in the methane [nu]4 band at 1304 cm-1 and a line-by-line radiative transfer code to infer the abundances of the trace constituents and some of their isotopes in Titan's stratosphere. No longitudinal variations were found for these gases. Little or no change is observed generally in their abundances from the south to the equator. On the other hand, meridional variations retrieved for these trace constituents from the equator to the North ranged from almost zero (no or very little meridional variations) for C2H2, C2H6, C3H8, C2H4 and CO2 to a significant enhancement at high northern (early winter) latitudes for HCN, HC3N, C4H2, C3H4 and C6H6. For the more important increases in the northern latitudes, the transition occurs roughly between 30 and 50 degrees north latitude, depending on the molecule. Note however that the very high-northern latitude results from tours TB-T10 bear large uncertainties due to few available data and problems with latitude smearing effects. The observed variations are consistent with some, but not all, of the predictions from dynamical-photochemical models. Constraints are set on the vertical distribution of C2H2, found to be compatible with 2-D equatorial predictions by global circulation models. The D/H ratio in the methane on Titan has been determined from the CH3D band at 1156 cm-1 and found to be . Implications of this deuterium enrichment, with respect to the protosolar abundance on the origin of Titan, are discussed. We compare our results with values retrieved by Voyager IRIS observations taken in 1980, as well as with more recent (1997) disk-averaged Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) results and with the latest Cassini-Huygens inferences from other instruments in an attempt to better comprehend the physical phenomena on Titan.},

In particular, we have reanalyzed the 8.6-[mu]m emission feature attributed to both C3H8 and CH3D bands. Observations were compared to synthetic spectra generated from an atmospheric model which incorporates recent results on the thermal structure and gas composition (in particular on the abundances of methane and propane) at Titan's equator from [Coustenis et al., 1989], Icarus, 80, 54-76.). The best fit approach and the error analysis yielded a CH3D mole fraction of 1.1+0.7-0.6 × 10-5 in the stratosphere and a CH3D/ CH4 ratio of 6+5.6-2.1 × 10-4. A value of D/H was derived, 1.5+1.4-0.5 × 10-4, which is in conflict with the results of the previous analysis by [Kim and Caldwell, 1982], Icarus 52, 473-482)--but consistent with their revised value ([Owen et al., 1986], Nature (London) 320, 244-246)--and in excellent agreement with the estimation deduced from observations in the 1.6-[mu]m CH3D band by [De Bergh et al., 1988], Astrophys. J. 329, 951-955). The associated error bars result mainly from instrumental noise and uncertainties in the thermal profile. Deuterium appears to be clearly enriched in Titan, but present uncertainties in the D/H ratio, both in the satellite and in the protosolar nebula, preclude a firm interpretation of the origin of the observed enrichment.},

A temperature profile for the stratosphere was retrieved from the best fit of the 7.7-[mu]m methane band in which the emission originates mainly from pressure levels between 0.01 and 3 mbar (150 and 400 km). Assuming uniform vertical distributions for all the absorbers above their condensation levels, the analysis of three different selections yields stratospheric mole fractions for the following species: C2H2 (2.2+0.7-0.9 × 10-6), C2H4 (9.0+3-5 × 10-8), C2H6 (1.3+0.5-0.7 × 10-5), C3H4 (4.4+1.7-2.1 × 10-9), C3H8 (7.0+4-4 × 10-7), C4H2 (1.4+0.6-0.7 × 10-9), HCN (1.6+0.4-0.6 × 10-7), and CO2 (1.4+0.3-0.5 × 10-8). Upper limits were obtained for the abundances of C2N2 (1.5 × 10-9) and HC3N (1.5 × 10-9). An altitude-dependent profile of CO2 was tested against observations but no conclusive information as to the vertical distribution of carbon dioxide could be extracted. The formation of emission lines for all of the minor components is found to originate from pressure levels between 1 and 20 mbar (75 and 200 km). There is no evidence for longitudinal variations in the atmospheric composition. The results are finally compared to previous studies and to current photochemical models.},

A maximal temperature decrease of 17 K at the 0.4-mbar level (225 km of altitude) is observed between 5[degree sign]S (the warmest region) and 70[degree sign]N, whereas the temperature drops only by ~3 K from 5[degree sign] to 53[degree sign]S. Mean molecular fractions, associated with atmospheric levels between 4 and 9 mbar, were derived from the best fit of the infrared data. The CO2 abundance remains constant from pole to pole within error bars. HCN shows a steady increase from south to north (total enhancement of > 30). For all the other molecules, variations in composition exist mainly between the equator and the north polar region. Ethane, acetylene, and propane show a moderate enrichment by about a factor of two. C4H2, C2H4, C3H4 show significantly higher mole fractions at latitudes > 50[degree sign]N (by factors of ~7-15). C2N2 and HC3N, undetected southward of 50[degree sign]N, show at least an order of magnitude enhancement near the north pole. The stratospheric haze opacity at wavenumbers larger than 600 cm-1 was found to show a north-to-south enhancement of ~2.5 +/- 0.3. Coldest temperatures, found at high northern latitudes, are associated with enhanced gas concentration and haze opacity, and this may be caused by more efficient radiative cooling (Bezard, B., A. Coustenis, and C. P. McKay 1995, Icarus 113,267-276). The observed latitudinal variations in hydrocarbons and nitriles may be related to seasonal and spatial variations of the solar flux (Yung, Y. L. 1987, Icarus 72, 468-472). The present results set constraints for the future development of 2-D seasonal photochemical models.},

  Abstract                 = {The temp. structure and vertical distributions of minor stratospheric constituents in Titan's north polar region have been inferred from the study of Voyager 1 IR spectra. The upper stratospheric temp. is retrieved from an anal. of the 7.7-mm CH4 band in which the emission originates mainly from pressure levels between 0.01 and 5 mbar (120 and 375 km). The thermal profile at 70 DegN is significantly colder (by .apprx.20 Deg K) than the equatorial one. Vertical distributions of the following absorbers were derived from the best fits obtained in the spectral region 200-1400 cm-1 for 3 different data sets (corresponding to 3 different altitudes above the satellite's surface): C2H2, C4H2, C2H6, C3H4, HCN, HC3N, and C2N2. The mixing ratios of these species increase with height, suggesting their formation in the upper stratosphere and above. The abundances of C2H8 and C2H4 could only be obtained near the 1.5-mbar level. When compared to the abundances derived at the equator, the nitriles HC3N and C2N2 and some of the hydrocarbons (C2H4, C3H4, and C4H2) are considerably enhanced in the north polar region. The upper limit of the CO2 abundance obtained near the north pole indicates a depletion of this gas with respect to the equator (by a factor of at least .apprx.2). Currently available photochem. models are insufficient to interpret these observations. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  Abstract                 = {Titan was obsd. with the Adaptive Optics Bonette at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope during Oct. 27th 1998 (UTC), when the satellite was at greatest eastern elongation (GEE) with respect to Saturn and its leading hemisphere was seen from the Earth. The seeing was excellent during these observations (with peaks at 0.3'' in the visible), and this allowed us to successfully image Titan for the 1st time in the J band, where the adaptive optics correction is highly dependent on the atm. conditions. Images were obtained in the center of the so-called \"methane windows,\" where the absorption is weak (at 1.29 -J1- and 1.6 mm -H1-) and also in the wings of the CH4 bands (at 1.18 mm -J2- and 1.64 mm -H2-) with narrowband filters. The latter wavelengths yield information on Titan's stratosphere and allow us, by subtracting its contribution from the J1 and H1 images, to infer furthermore direct information on the surface properties. The resoln. on the J and H diffraction-limited images is .apprx.0.08-0.1'', translating into .apprx.10 independent resoln. elements or 20 pixels on the Titan disk. We have obtained reconstructed PSFs of very high signal-to-noise ratio, with assocd. Strehl ratios of .apprx.35% in J and 50% in H. Hence, new and more efficient deconvolution methods (such as MISTRAL) were applied to the images, reducing ringing defects and restoring the initial photometry while enhancing the contrast on the obsd. features. Thus, the main features of the Titan atm. (bright south pole) and surface (large bright equatorial region and darker areas) - as previously obsd. with ADONIS/ESO, as well as with the HST and the Keck telescopes-are apparent, but with a much higher level of detail and contrast (.apprx.30%) at these wavelengths. In addn., on the J1 and J2 images, along with the north-south asymmetry (which is probably due to seasonal effects), another bright feature is reported for the 1st time seen on Titan's morning limb (anti-Saturn during GEE). This feature may be diagnostic of diurnal effects (such as morning fog) at altitudes of 70-90 km (due to the cycle of the condensable species), but requires further investigation before its origin can be firmly identified. On the surface images (cor. for limb effects and atm. contribution), the large equatorial feature is found to be bright also at 1.3 mm (thus further constraining models of the surface compn.). The high quality of the data allows us to resolve this area into 3 or more individual peaks, possibly towering over a mountainous plateau covered with ice (a plausible candidate being ethane ice). In any event, our images show this part of Titan's leading hemisphere to be more complex than previously suggested by models of Titan's surface. From our albedo maps, it appears that the darker areas have reflectances that are .apprx.3 times lower than the bright equatorial region. (c) 2001 Academic Press. [on SciFinder (R)]},

The resolving power was 10000, 1000, and 300 for the 1991, 1993, and 1994 spectra, resp. The data sets cover Titan's Greatest Western Elongation and opposite Conjunctions. The Titan's geometric albedo is about the same (0.29) at 1.28 and 1.075 mm; on the other hand, observations of Uranus show the 1.28-mm albedo to be lower by 30% than that in the 1.075-mm window. At the four wavelengths, a noticeable decrease in geometric albedo is obsd. near Greatest Western Elongation with respect to Inferior and Superior Conjunctions. The sum of the existing Titan data point to a bright leading side and a darker trailing one, with a max. brightness near 120 Deg (+-20 Deg) orbital longitude and a min. near 230 Deg (+-20 Deg). Despite important uncertainties in the value of the CH4 absorption coeffs. in the window regions, modeling Titan's obsd. albedos strongly suggests the existence of a surface material with a comparable albedo at 1.075 and 1.28 mm (0.4-0.5) but much darker at 1.6 and 2.0 mm (about 0.2). Titan's surface spectrum appears consistent with that of Hyperion and we suggest that this behavior may be due to the dominant presence of water ice on Titan's surface.

Due to the interference of telluric absorption, only part of this window region (2.9-3.1 [mu]m) has previously been observed from the ground [Noll, K.S., Geballe, T.R., Knacke, R., Pendleton, F., Yvonne, J., 1996.

We report here on the first spectroscopic observations of Titan covering the whole 2.4-4.9 [mu]m region by two instruments on board the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) in 1997. These observations show the 2.75-[mu]m window in its complete extent for the first time. In this study we have also used a high-resolution Titan spectrum in the 2.9-3.6 [mu]m region taken with the Keck [Geballe, T.R., Kim, S.J., Noll, K.S., Griffith, C.A., 2003. Astrophys. J. 583, L39-L42; Kim, S.J., Geballe, T.R., Noll, K.S., Courtin, R., 2005. Icarus 173, 522-532] to infer information on the atmospheric parameters (haze extinction, single scattering albedo, methane abundance, etc.) by fitting the methane bands with a detailed microphysical model of Titan's atmosphere (updated from Rannou, P., McKay, C.P., Lorenz, R.D., 2003. Planet. Space Sci. 51, 963-976). We have included in this study an updated version of a database for the CH4 absorption coefficients [STDS, Wenger, Ch., Champion, J.-P., 1998. J. Quant. Spectrosc. Radiat. Transfer 59, 471-480. See also http://www.u-bourgogne.fr/LPUB/TSM/sTDS.html for latest updates; Boudon, V., Champion, J.-P., Gabard, T., Loete, M., Michelot, F., Pierre, G., Rotger, M., Wenger, Ch., Rey, M., 2004. J. Mol. Spectrosc. 228, 620-634]. For the atmosphere we find that (a) the haze extinction profile that best matches the data is one with higher (by 40%) extinction in the atmosphere with respect to Rannou et al. (2003) down to about 30 km where a complete cut-off occurs; (b) the methane mixing ratio at Titan's surface cannot exceed 3% on a disk-average basis, yielding a maximum CH4 column abundance of 2.27 km-am in Titan's atmosphere. From the derived surface albedo spectrum in the 2.7-3.08 micron region, we bring some constraints on Titan's surface composition. The albedo in the center of the methane window varies from 0.01 to 0.08. These values, compared to others reported in the other methane windows, show a strong compatibility with the water ice spectrum in the near-infrared. Without confirming its existence from this work alone, our data then appear to be compatible with water ice. A variety of other ices, such as CO2, NH3, tholin material or hydrocarbon liquid cannot be excluded from our data, but an additional unidentified component with a signature around 2.74 micron is required to satisfy the data.},

  Abstract                 = {We have analyzed Titan observations performed by the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) in the range 7-30 [mu]m. The spectra obtained by three of the instruments on board the mission (the short wavelength spectrometer, the photometer, and the camera) were combined to provide new and more precise thermal and compositional knowledge of Titan's stratosphere. With the high spectral resolution achieved by the SWS (much higher than that of the Voyager 1 IRIS spectrometer), we were able to detect and separate the contributions of most of the atmospheric gases present on Titan and to determine disk-averaged mole fractions. We have also tested existing vertical distributions for C2H2, HCN, C2H6, and CO2 and inferred some information on the abundance of the first species as a function of altitude. From the CH3D band at 1161 cm-1 and for a CH4 mole fraction assumed to be 1.9\% in Titan's stratosphere, we have obtained the monodeuterated methane-averaged abundance and retrieved a D/H isotopic ratio of 8.7-1.9+3.2 x 10-5. We discuss the implications of this value with respect to current evolutionary scenarios for Titan. The [nu]5 band of HC3N at 663 cm-1 was observed for the first time in a disk-averaged spectrum. We have also obtained a first tentative detection of benzene at 674 cm-1, where the fit of the ISO/SWS spectrum at R = 1980 is significantly improved when a constant mean mole fraction of 4 x 10-10 of C6H6 is incorporated into the atmospheric model. This corresponds to a column density of ~ 2 x 1015 molecules cm-2 above the 30-mbar level. We have also tested available vertical profiles for HC3N and C6H6 and adjusted them to fit the data. Finally, we have inferred upper limits of a few 10-10 for a number of molecules proposed as likely candidates on Titan (such as allene, acetonitrile, propionitrile, and other more complex gases).},

  Abstract                 = {Solar and X-ray radiation and energetic plasma from Saturn's magnetosphere interact with the upper atmosphere producing an ionosphere at Titan. The highly coupled ionosphere and upper atmosphere system mediates the interaction between Titan and the external environment. A model of Titan's nightside ionosphere will be described and the results compared with data from the Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) and the Langmuir probe (LP) part of the Radio and Plasma Wave (RPWS) experiment for the T5 and T21 nightside encounters of the Cassini Orbiter with Titan. Electron impact ionization associated with the precipitation of magnetospheric electrons into the upper atmosphere is assumed to be the source of the nightside ionosphere, at least for altitudes above 1000 km. Magnetospheric electron fluxes measured by the Cassini electron spectrometer (CAPS ELS) are used as an input for the model. The model is used to interpret the observed composition and structure of the T5 and T21 ionospheres. The densities of many ion species (e.g., CH+5 and C2H+5) measured during T5 exhibit temporal and/or spatial variations apparently associated with variations in the fluxes of energetic electrons that precipitate into the atmosphere from Saturn's magnetosphere.},

  Abstract                 = {Titan possesses an extensive neutral atm. consisting mainly of mol. nitrogen and methane. Titan also has an ionosphere due to the photoionization of the neutrals by solar extreme UV photons or due to ionization by energetic electrons assocd. with Saturn's magnetosphere. Saturn's magnetospheric plasma and field impinges on Titan's atm. and ionosphere with a flow speed of about 120 km/s. We are studying Titan's plasma environment using a two-dimensional (2-D), quasi-multifluid MHD (MHD) model which maintains high spatial resoln. in Titan's ionosphere by employing a grid with cylindrical geometry and non-uniform radial grid spacing. The ion species included in the model are a generic light (e.g., H+, H2+), medium (e.g., N+, CH5+), and heavy (e.g., N2+, H2CN+) species. The inner boundary is located at an altitude of 725 km and the outer boundary at a radial distance of 1.5 * 106 km. Titan first begins to affect the external magnetospheric plasma flow at a distance of about 10 Titan radii (or 10 RT). The plasma flow is subsonic, although super-Alfvenic, and a bow shock does not appear in the model results. The flow for radial distances between about 2 and 10 RT qual. resembles potential flow around a hard cylinder. The flow inside 2 RT is much slower due to the collisional build-up of a magnetic barrier and due to the collisional interaction of the plasma with Titan's neutral atm. Comparison will be made with the results of an earlier 1-D MHD model of Titan's ionosphere (Keller, Cravens and Gan, 1994) and with a 3-D single fluid MHD model. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  Abstract                 = {Energetic protons and oxygen ions have been observed in Saturn's outer magnetosphere and can precipitate into Titan's atmosphere where they deposit energy, ionize, and drive ionospheric chemistry. Ion production rates caused by this precipitation are calculated using fluxes of incident 27 keV to 4 MeV protons measured by the Cassini MIMI instrument. We find that significant ion production rates exist in the 500 km to 1000 km altitude range and estimate associated electron densities of about 200–2000 cm−3 in reasonable agreement with measured densities. We demonstrate that energetic oxygen ions do not penetrate below about 650 km, but they can also generate significant ionization. We suggest that a few percent of the oxygen flux is converted to negative O ions as a consequence of charge exchange collisions, which might help explain the negative ions observed near 960 km by the Cassini CAPS instrument.},

  Abstract                 = {Spectrophotometric studies of Triton suggest a surface covered in part by solid methane. N is suspected on the basis of a single spectral band, but this material, if present, must be in a condensed state. Liq. N covering part of Triton to a depth of a few tens of cm can satisfy the spectral data so far available. If condensed N occurs on Triton, the satellite has an atm. largely of N2 (pressure .apprx.0.1 bar), with CH4 as a minor constituent. The reddish hue of Triton's surface may result from photochem. derivs. of the methane and N, as in the case of Titan. The radius of Triton was detd. by indirect means to be 1750 km, but there may be a large systematic error in this value. If the mean d. is .apprx.2-3 g/cm3, the mass derived from astrometric observations is in error. There is no information on phys. properties of Nereid.

  Abstract                 = {The near-IR spectrum of Triton is characterized by strong absorption bands of CH4, probably in the solid state. An addnl. absorption band at 2.16 mm is tentatively identified as the d.-induced (2-0) band of mol. N2 in the liq. state. Using the absorption coeff. for this band derived from lab. observations and from the literature, it is calcd. that Triton must have a layer of N at least tens of cm deep over much of its surface; this quantity is plausible in terms of the cosmic abundance of N and by comparison with Titan where a massive atm. of N exists. The Triton spectrum has been modeled with liq. N and solid CH4; the shape of the continuum in 2 spectral regions can be properly accounted for by adding a spectral component corresponding to fine-grained water frost. Yet another component, a dark, solid, photochem. deriv. of CH4, may occur as a trace contaminant of the surface materials. If much of the surface of Triton is liq., the radiometric observations of the satellite must be reinterpreted to derive the radius and surface albedo. If there is liq. N exposed on the surface, the atm. of Triton is probably dominated by N rather than CH4 because of the much higher vapor pressure of the former. At the calcd. subsolar temp. of Triton, the vapor pressure of N implies a surface atm. pressure of 0.13-0.30 atm. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  Abstract                 = {For accurate thermochemical tests of electronic structure theory, accurate true anharmonic zero-point vibrational energies ZPVEtrue are needed. We discuss several possibilities to extract this information for molecules from density functional or wave function calculations and/or available experimental data:â (1) Empirical universal scaling of density-functional-calculated harmonic ZPVEharms, where we find that polyatomics require smaller scaling factors than diatomics. (2) Direct density-functional calculation by anharmonic second-order perturbation theory PT2. (3) Weighted averages of harmonic ZPVEharm and fundamental ZPVEfund (from fundamental vibrational transition frequencies), with weights (3/4, 1/4) for diatomics and (5/8,3/8) for polyatomics. (4) Experimental correction of the PT2 harmonic contribution, i.e., the estimate ZPV + (ZPV â ZPV ) for ZPVEtrue. The (5/8,3/8) average of method 3 and the additive correction of method 4 have been proposed here. For our database of experimental ZPVEtrue, consisting of 27 diatomics and 8 polyatomics, we find that methods 1 and 2, applied to the popular B3LYP and the nonempirical PBE and TPSS functionals and their one-parameter hybrids, yield polyatomic errors on the order of 0.1 kcal/mol. Larger errors are expected for molecules larger than those in our database. Method 3 yields errors on the order of 0.02 kcal/mol, but requires very accurate (e.g., experimental, coupled cluster, or best-performing density functional) input harmonic ZPVEharm. Method 4 is the best-founded one that meets the requirements of high accuracy and practicality, requiring as experimental input only the highly accurate and widely available ZPV and producing errors on the order of 0.05 kcal/mol that are relatively independent of functional and basis set. As a part of our study, we also test the ability of the density functionals to predict accurate equilibrium bond lengths and angles for a data set of 21 mostly polyatomic molecules (since all calculated ZPVEs are evaluated at the correspondingly calculated molecular geometries).},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we present an in-depth study of the distributions of various neutral species in Titan's upper atmosphere, between 950 and 1,500 km for abundant species (N2, CH4, H2) and between 950 and 1,200 km for other minor species. Our analysis is based on a large sample of Cassini/INMS (Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer) measurements in the CSN (Closed Source Neutral) mode, obtained during 15 close flybys of Titan. To untangle the overlapping cracking patterns, we adopt Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to determine simultaneously the densities of different species. Except for N2, CH4, H2 and 40Ar (as well as their isotopes), all species present density enhancements measured during the outbound legs. This can be interpreted as a result of wall effects, which could be either adsorption/desorption of these molecules or heterogeneous surface chemistry of the associated radicals on the chamber walls. In this paper, we provide both direct inbound measurements assuming ram pressure enhancement only and abundances corrected for wall adsorption/desorption based on a simple model to reproduce the observed time behavior. Among all minor species of photochemical interest, we have firm detections of C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, CH3C2H, C4H2, C6H6, CH3CN, HC3N, C2N2 and NH3 in Titan's upper atmosphere. Upper limits are given for other minor species. The globally averaged distributions of N2, CH4 and H2 are each modeled with the diffusion approximation. The N2 profile suggests an average thermospheric temperature of 151 K. The CH4 and H2 profiles constrain their fluxes to be and , referred to Titan's surface. Both fluxes are significantly higher than the Jeans escape values. The INMS data also suggest horizontal/diurnal variations of temperature and neutral gas distribution in Titan's thermosphere. The equatorial region, the ramside, as well as the nightside hemisphere of Titan appear to be warmer and present some evidence for the depletion of light species such as CH4. Meridional variations of some heavy species are also observed, with a trend of depletion toward the north pole. Though some of the above variations might be interpreted by either the solar-driven models or auroral-driven models, a physical scenario that reconciles all the observed horizontal/diurnal variations in a consistent way is still missing. With a careful evaluation of the effect of restricted sampling, some of the features shown in the INMS data are more likely to be observational biases.},

In this model various structural quantities (geometries, dissociation energies, harmonic frequencies...) are required for both the parent cluster and the fragments. They have been obtained from quantum chemistry calculations for Cn up to n = 9. Experimentally, a new detection system for high velocity fragments has been recently developed allowing the fragmentation of high velocity clusters to be totally recorded. Results for the branching ratios of deexcitation of Cn with 5 <= n <= 9 formed by electron capture in high velocity Cn+-He collisions are presented. In all cases, the agreement between theory and experiment is reasonably good provided that the theoretical branching ratios are convoluted with a Cn energy distribution centered at around 10 eV.},

This value is .apprx.2 times higher than the value measured on Uranus (de B. et al., 1986) and .apprx.6 times higher than on Jupiter and on Saturn (Courtin R., et al. (1984); de B. et al.). It corresponds to D/H of (1.65-0.8+1.65) * 10-4, nominally 8 times higher than the most commonly accepted value for the protosolar D/H = 2 * 10-5 (Geiss, J. and Reeves H., 1981).

The anal. of this spectrum, using spectral synthesis techniques, yielded a CH3D/CH4 ratio of 6-4+6 * 10-4, which corresponds to a global D/H ratio for Neptune of 1.2-0.8+1.2 * 10-4, if CH3D is in isotopic fractionation equil. with HD. This value is about an order of magnitude larger than an earlier est. by G. Orton et al. (1987) based on deconvolution measurements of unresolved mol. emission in the 8-10 mm region. Comparison of this new detn. with previous studies of CH3D in the outer solar system shows that, as in the case of Uranus, the D/H on Neptune is strongly enhanced over that found on Jupiter and Saturn and is comparable to the D/H in methane on Titan and in terrestrial methane and water.

After production, the formation of the suprathermal particles is modeled using a two-stream simulation, as they travel simultaneously through a thermal mixture of N2, CH4, and H2. The resulting suprathermal fluxes, hot density profiles, and energy distributions are compared to the N2 and CH4 INMS exospheric data presented in [De La Haye, V., Waite Jr., J.H., Johnson, R.E., Yelle, R.V., Cravens, T.E., Luhmann, J.G., Kasprzak, W.T., Gell, D.A., Magee, B., Leblanc, F., Michael, M., Jurac, S., Robertson, I.P., 2007.

Energy inputs from the Sun and from Saturn's magnetosphere and updated temperature and eddy coefficient parameters are taken into account. A rotating technique at constant latitude and varying local-time is proposed to account for the diurnal variation of solar inputs. The contributions of photodissocation, neutral chemistry, ion-neutral chemistry, and electron recombination to neutral production are presented as a function of altitude and local time. Local time-dependent mixing ratio and density profiles are presented in the context of the TA and T5 Cassini data and are compared in detail to previous models. An independent and simplified ion and neutral scheme (19-species) is also proposed for future 3D-purposes. The model results demonstrate that a complete understanding of the chemistry of Titan's upper atmosphere requires an understanding of the coupled ion and neutral chemistry. In particular, the ionospheric chemistry makes significant contributions to production rates of several important neutral species.},

Previous work has suggested that these large mass ions could be composed of fused-ring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon compounds. These fused-ring PAH's, such as naphthalene and anthracene, are usually the result of high temperature processes that may not occur in Titan's thin, cold, upper thermosphere. Here we suggest that a different class of aromatic compounds, polyphenyls, may be a better explanation of the data. Polyphenyls can grow to be large polymeric structures and could condense to form the aerosols seen in Titan's cloud and hazes. They have similar properties to fused-ring PAH's (for example, electron affinity, ionization potential) and could be the negative ion species seen in the CAPS instrument data from the Cassini spacecraft.},

  Abstract                 = {Much emphasis has been devoted recently to the experimental determination of absolute electron-impact ionization cross sections of molecules and radicals because of the importance of these cross sections in many applications (e.g. as input parameters to modeling codes for various purposes). Supporting theoretical calculations have been lagging behind to some extent. Because of the inherent complexity of such calculations, simplistic additivity rules and semiempirical methods have often been used in place of more rigorous calculation schemes, particularly in applications where a larger number of cross section data were needed with reasonable precision. Although these methods have often proved to be quite successful as descriptive tools (i.e. reproducing existing experimental ionization cross sections reasonably well), their ability to calculate cross sections for species for which no experimental data are available (predictive capabilities) tend to be limited or questionable. This topical review describes recent progress in the development of more rigorous approaches for the calculation of absolute electron-impact molecular ionization cross sections. The main emphasis will be on the application of the semiclassical Deutsch-Mark (DM) formalism, which was originally developed for the calculation of atomic ionization cross sections, to molecular targets, and on the binary-encounter-Bethe (BEB) method of Kim and Rudd. The latter is a simpler version of the more rigorous binary-encounter-dipole (BED) theory, which was also first developed for the calculation of atomic ionization cross sections, and based on the methods developed by Khare and co-workers. Extensive comparisons between available experimental cross sections and the predictions of these theoretical models will be made for 31 molecules and free radicals (H2, N2, O2, S2, C2, C3, O3, H2O, NH3, CO2, CH4, CH3, CH2, CH, CF4, CF3, CF2, CF, NF3, NF2, NF, SiF3, SiF2, SiF, TiCl4, C2H2, C2H6, C6H6, SiF6, C2F6, CH3OH).},

  Abstract                 = {Titan, the sixth Saturnine moon, is a unique celestial body in many respects, including the existence of a high-d. atm. over a relatively small astrophys. object, chem. activity in the low-potential reducing medium, the presence of an extensive aerosol domain, etc. Despite many observations, simulation expts. and theor. models, the general picture of Titan's atm. photochem. is still imprecise. This study of the most general features of chem. activity in Titan's atm. by means of Generalized Kinetic Anal. (GKA) is based on the point that both the probability and efficiency of kinetic trends are estd. solely on the basis of energy/material restrictions and general kinetic laws. Only the quantity (intensity) and quality (spectrum) of the external driving force are considered closely, while both the particular kinetic demands and low internal energy resources of Titan's background are discounted. What this means is that the main inferences of GKA should be valid for any given kinetic model. Only a small part Lch of the total external energy flux Labs.apprx.12.6 W m-2 is photochem. active Lch = (L1ion + L2ion + L1dis) + L2ch = (1.5 * 10-3 + 0.22 * 10-3 + 10.6 * 10-3) + 0.69 W m-2. The secondary energy L2ch (1440<l<3500.ANG.) meets the common energy requirements, while the primary energies L1ion, L2ion and L1dis define kinetic pathways of the chem. process, i.e. L1ion (790<l<980.ANG.) and L2ion (l<790.ANG.) initiate ionic photochem. via ionization of CH4 and N2, resp., while L1dis (980<l<1440.ANG.) provides photodissocn. of CH4 to neutral species. Because of severe energy/material restrictions, the general chem. process proceeds in the form of a self-sustaining Diels-Alder diene low-temp. synthesis to give telomerization and polymn. GKA proves that the main kinetic pathways (photodissocn. to neutrals and charged photoionization) play different roles with respect to the quant. and qual. formation of the final stable products of Titan's atm. photochem. The neutral pathway governs the bulk (overall yield) of the final products while ionic chem. is responsible for its wide chem. compn. (variety of chem. species). Species identification in terms of hydrocarbon type content results in the following wt. ratio compn. of the final products: dienes (0.60-0.65) + satd./unsatd. acyclic pure hydrocarbons (0.16-0.19) + tholins (0.07-0.08) + isocyclics (0.03-0.05) + misc.

  Abstract                 = {A two-dimensional photochem. transport model is developed for Titan's stratosphere. Transformed Eulerian mean equations are used to det. the meridional circulation. Mech. forcing is modeled using eddy and Rayleigh friction, while thermal forcing is provided by Newtonian and eddy heating. The model contains 117 photolysis, chem., and condensation reactions for 22 hydrocarbon species along with at. and mol. hydrogen. The method of conservation of second-order moments is used for the meridional and vertical advection calcns. Coustenis and Bezard (1995) analyzed the Voyager IRIS data to calc. hydrocarbon abundances from 53 DegS to 70 DegN. They detd. that the ethane mixing ratio was approx. const. for all sampled latitudes. In the absence of meridional transport, photochem. would yield higher concns. of C2 and C3 hydrocarbon species near the equator than near the poles. Meridional advection results in enough tracer transport from low to high latitudes that the latitudinal distributions for ethane are much more uniform. The model shows methane is well mixed in Titan's stratosphere. Model mixing ratios for ethane and propane agree well with Voyager IRIS data; however, the model overestimates the abundances of acetylene and diacetylene. The model abundance for methylacetylene is within the Voyager observational uncertainty, but the abundance for mid-southern latitudes is at the high end of this uncertainty. The model does not accurately reproduce the obsd. ethylene abundances. Mid-latitude column densities (above 5 mbar) for ethane, propane, acetylene, and methylacetylene vary seasonal by 10, 14, 9.5, and 12%, resp. Large seasonal variations for short-lived chem. species results in significant seasonal variations in the chem. prodn. rates for org. polymers at middle and high latitudes. (c) 2000 Academic Press.

Batch processes are more flexible compared to continuous processes and are frequently used in these situations. Stochastic optimization methods provide a general approach to robust/ parameter design as compared to conventional techniques. However, the computational burden of these approaches can be extreme and depends on the sample size used for characterizing the parametric variations and uncertainties. In this paper, we present a novel sampling technique. The example of robust batch distillation column design illustrates that the new sampling technique offers significant computational savings and better accuracy.},

This abstract model mimics a C-H-O-N system that might get an insight into the general properties of the chemistry of Titan's atmosphere. Comparison with detailed models like photochemical models is discussed to evaluate limitations and benefits of each approach. Comparison with observations suggests that Titan's atmosphere might self-organize to produce hydrocarbons with distributions that follow a power-law relation. If confirmed, this property makes possible some prediction about the abundance of heavy hydrocarbons in the atmosphere of Titan.},

The time period considered is from 1940 to the present, with an emphasis on results published since 1990. One hundred ninety-four articles were considered involving hundreds of compounds. The goals of this paper are to show how the nature and extent of estimations of uncertainty have changed in this time period and to document the extent to which the information provided in the articles corresponds to the recommendations of the GUM. (The GUM is the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement published in 1993 by the International Organization for Standardization, ISO. This document describes current recommended practices in this area.) It is shown that although gradual and continuous progress has been made in the reporting of uncertainty information, comprehensive uncertainty analyses remain rare, particularly with regard to the consideration of contributions arising from sample impurities. Problems in the application of experimental property results to technological challenges are discussed within the broad context of inconsistencies in the expression of uncertainty. Widespread acceptance and application of the standard methods and terminologies established within the GUM are encouraged for the benefit of experimentalists, data evaluators, and data users alike.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract: The rate coefficient for the recombination of methyl radicals, CH3 + CH3 C2H6, was measured in incident shock-wave experiments on azomethane (0.12-1.3%) in argon. Methyl radicals were detected at 46 294 cm-1 (215.94 nm in air) by the tunable-laser flash-absorption technique. Postshock pressures between 114 and 230 kPa (1.13-2.27 atm) produced buffer gas concentrations between 5.4 × 1018 and 1.1 × 1019 cm-3. The cross section for optical absorption, the rate of dissociation of azomethane, and the rate coefficient of the recombinational reaction were determined simultaneously by least-squares analysis of methyl absorption profiles. The rate coefficient for the dissociation of azomethane from 850 to 1430 K is kdis(T) = 2.22 × 1039T-7.99 exp{-25920/T(K)} s-1. The temperature-dependent rate of recombination at 1.2 atm compares favorably with previous measurements. In terms of the phenomenological three-parameter equation of Kooji and the asymmetric Lorentzian broadening function of Gilbert et al., the recombination data from 296 to 1800 K may be described by k(T) = 1.53 × 10-7 T-1.203 exp{-295/T(K)} cm3s-1, k0(T) = 1.70 × 10-5T-7.248 exp{-2172/T(K)} cm6 s-1, and Fcent(T) = exp{-T(K)/506}.},

  Abstract                 = {Surface temp. and atm. compn. inferred from a recent reanal. of Voyager 1 measurements of E. Lellouch et al. (1989), are used to constrain several properties of Titan's ocean. Thermodn. equil. is assumed between atm. and ocean. The ocean is considered as a nonideal soln. Depending on atm. parameters, the main ocean features can vary drastically. Assuming a 92.5K surface temp., a 1.5-atm surface pressure, and an Ar-free atm., a 1.55% CH4 mole fraction in the low troposphere implies an ocean composed of >90% C2H8 (and heavier alkanes), .apprx.7.3% CH4, and 1.8% N. At 101K for the same surface pressure with an atm. contg. 17% Ar and 21.1% CH4, the ocean is composed of 5% C2H6 and higher alkanes, 83.4% CH4, 6% N, and 5.6% Ar. Other components are quant. negligible. The solubilities and thickness of ppt. for several minor oceanic components are derived and presented. Thickness of solid deposits formed at the bottom of the ocean are not very dependent on surface temp. and atm. compn. The ocean can be an important CO reservoir, able to hold from 0.25 time (CH6 rich ocean at 92.5 DegK) ?11 times (CH4-rich ocean at 101 DegK) the atm. CO inventory. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract: We present an accurate parametrization of density functional theory augmented with an empirical correction term to describe properly -stacking interactions in nucleic acids. The approach is based on the popular Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE), Becke-Perdew (BP), and hybrid Becke-Lee-Yang-Parr (B3LYP) density functionals augmented by a classical London C6R-6 dispersion term. The novelty of our implementation lies in the accurate tuning of the empirical parameters, included in the f d(R) damping function, to reproduce high-level post Hartree-Fock calculations. In particular, we present sets of parameters and the needed code to correct the PBE, BP, and B3LYP results from the Turbomole and ADF packages in connection with basis sets of double and triple quality. The developed approach is validated by comparison with the JSCH-2005 benchmark and with best quality stacking energies reported in the literature for the stacking of H-bonded nucleic acids base pairs.},

Samples were deformed in compressional creep tests (i.e., const. applied stress, s), at conditions of confining pressure P = 50 and 100 MPa, strain rate 4.5 * 10-8 ? .ovrhdot..vepsiln. ? 4.3 * 10-4 s-1, temp. 260 ? T ? 287 K, and internal methane pressure 10 ? PCH4 ? 15 MPa. At steady state, typically reached in a few percent strain, methane hydrate exhibited strength that was far higher than expected on the basis of published work. In terms of the std. high-temp. creep law, .ovrhdot..vepsiln. = Asne-(E*+PV*)/RT the rheol. is described by the consts. A = 108.55 MPa-n s-1, n = 2.2, E* = 90,000 J mol-1, and V* = 19 cm3 mol-1. For comparison, at temps. just below the ice point, methane hydrate at a given strain rate is over 20 times stronger than ice, and the contrast increases at lower temps. The possible occurrence of syntectonic dissocn. of methane hydrate to methane plus free water in these expts. suggests that the high strength measured here may be only a lower bound. On Earth, high strength in hydrate-bearing formations implies higher energy release upon decompn. and subsequent failure. In the outer Solar system, if Titan has a 100-km-thick near-surface layer of high-strength, low-thermal cond. methane hydrate as has been suggested, its interior is likely to be considerably warmer than previously expected.

A modified maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) was developed to compensate for localized background fluorescence and instrument response. With this algorithm, we were able to robustly extract fluorescent lifetimes from their respective decays with as few as 20 photons. Fluorescent lifetimes extracted using an MLE were found to be highly dependent on background fluorescence. We show that appropriate factors are required to extract true lifetime trajectories from single fluorophores.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract: This paper presents a study of the dissociative recombination of C3H7+ with electrons in a heavy-ion storage ring, CRYRING. Cross sections were measured as a function of kinetic energy and found to be extremely rapid with a dependence of E-1.10±0.01. The recombination cross section was integrated to yield a thermal rate coefficient of 1.9 × 10-6 cm3 s-1. Product branching ratios were measured and proved to be quite complex. Although 16 channels are energetically accessible at 0 eV, it was not possible to assign branching ratios to all channels; some related channels were combined in the analysis. The results show that the dissociation channel corresponding to loss of a single hydrogen atom dominates, with a branching ratio of 0.42. Multiple H-loss channels are also observed. Product channels that involve breaking a C-C bond have a combined branching ratio ranging from 0.34 to 0.39.},

Mass-spectrometry measurements were performed at FOM of the solid phase of various tholins by Curie-point pyrolysis Gas-Chromatography/Mass-Spectrometry (GCMS) and by temperature resolved in source Pyrolysis Mass-Spectrometry to reveal the composition and evolution temperature of the dissociation products. The results presented here are used to further define the ACP (Aerosol Collector Pyrolyser)-GCMS experiment and provide a basis for modelling of aerosol composition on Titan and for the interpretation of Titan atmosphere data from the Huygens probe in the future.

  Abstract                 = {IR spectra of planetary atmospheres show a large variety of features. They are dominated by the signatures of their most spectroscopically active constituents: CO2 in the case of the terrestrial planets, and CH4 in the case of the giant planets. Minor species are also detectable, in particular: CO and H2O in the terrestrial planets with, in addn., O3 in the Earth atm.; NH3 and PH3 in Jupiter and Saturn; several hydrocarbons in all giant planets and Titan. To search for spectral signatures in exoplanets, the 6-15 mm range is esp. appropriate. Assuming that all sources of noise (apart from the detector noise) can be completely removed, the required integration time for detecting an Earth-like planet at 5 parsec (assuming the performances of the ISO detectors) is about two weeks for a 5-m telescope (R=100, S/N=5). Improving the sensitivity of the detectors would reduce these integration times accordingly. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  Abstract                 = {High-resolution spectroscopy in the millimeter and submillimeter range has made significant contributions to the study of chemical composition and thermal structure of planetary and satellite atmospheres. This field of research is expected to make considerable progress in the future, from both ground-based and space experiments, with the availability of heterodyne receivers at frequencies up to 1 THz, and with the development of space missions devoted to the exploration of the far-infrared and submillimeter range. A compilation of guidelines for searching molecular species in planetary atmospheres through their rotational transitions, from the millimeter to the far-infrared range (100 [mu]m) is presented. These transitions are specified, and the corresponding synthetic spectra are shown, or detectability limits are estimated. Several observational scenarios are considered: (1) ground-based heterodyne observations (such as those with IRAM, CSO, JCMT); (2) space heterodyne observations with a 3 m antenna (such as that on the European FIRST space mission); (3) Fabry-Perot spectroscopic observations from the ground and from space (such as the ISO and FIRST space missions). All planets (except Mercury) and the three satellites surrounded by an atmosphere, Titan, Triton and Io, are considered. The main results of this compilation can be summarized as follows. In addition to previously detected molecules, several species appear as promising candidates for detection in the far-infrared to millimeter spectral range. For ground-based heterodyne observations, they include: HCl, O3 and SO on Venus; HCl, O3, H2O2 and NO on Mars; HCl in the giant planets; SO on Io. For space observations, they are: O2 on Venus and Mars (provided Venus is observable with FIRST), H2O in Saturn and Titan (with ISO and FIRST); HD, HCl and other halides in the giant planets (ISO). In the case of heterodyne observations, detectability limits are also indicated. They typically correspond to mixing ratios in the range 10-8-10-10, depending upon the strength of the observed transition. It should be noted that a 30 m antenna operating at 230 GHz remains very competitive, especially for small objects (e.g. Io) with large dilution factors. Heterodyne observations of Triton and Pluto appear beyond the limit of detection.},

The main results are (1) the detection of water vapor in the deep troposphere of Saturn; (2) the detection of new hydrocarbons (CH3C2H, C4H2, C6H6, CH3) in Saturn's stratosphere; (3) the detection of water vapor and CO2 in the stratospheres of Jupiter and Saturn; (4) a new detn. of the D/H ratio from the detection of HD rotational lines. The origin of the external oxygen source on Jupiter and Saturn (also found in the other giant planets and Titan in comparable amts.) may be either interplanetary (micrometeoritic flux) or local (rings and/or satellites). The D/H detn. in Jupiter, comparable to Saturn's result, is in agreement with the recent measurement by the Galileo probe.

  Abstract                 = {This work examines the sensitivity of docking programs to tiny changes in ligand input files. The results show that nearly identical ligand input structures can produce dramatically different top-scoring docked poses. Even changing the atom order in a ligand input file can produce significantly different poses and scores. In well-behaved cases the docking variations are small and follow a normal distribution around a central pose and score, but in many cases the variations are large and reflect wildly different top scores and binding modes. The docking variations are characterized by statistical methods, and the sensitivity of high-throughput and more precise docking methods are compared. The results demonstrate that part of docking variation is due to numerical sensitivity and potentially chaotic effects in current docking algorithms and not solely due to incomplete ligand conformation and pose searching. These results have major implications for the way docking is currently used for pose prediction, ranking, and virtual screening.},

  Abstract                 = {The variability of docking results as a function of variations in ligand input conformations was studied for the GOLD, Glide, FlexX, and Surflex programs. It is concluded that there are two major effects leading to such variability: the adequacy of conformational search during docking and random "chaotic" effects arising from sensitivity to small input perturbations. It is shown that although the former is generally the stronger effect, the latter is also highly significant for almost all docking engines. The strong target-to-target variation of the magnitude of these effects is emphasized. The performance of different packages is compared using these measures. Guidelines are provided for different programs to reduce variability and improve reproducibility, which involve using a small number of input conformations as starting points for docking, followed by the selection of the top scoring docked pose from the results as the best docked solution.},

  Abstract                 = {The sensitivity of docking calculations to the geometry of the input ligand was studied. It was found that even small changes in the ligand input conformation can lead to large differences in the geometries and scores of the resulting docked poses. The accuracy of docked poses produced from different ligand input structures-the X-ray structure, the minimized Corina structure, and structures generated from conformational searches and molecular dynamics ensembles-were also assessed. It was found that using the X-ray ligand conformation as docking input does not always produce the most accurate docked pose when compared with other sources of ligand input conformations. Furthermore, no one method of conformer generation is guaranteed to always produce the most accurate docking pose. The docking scores are also highly sensitive to the source of the input conformation, which might introduce some noise in compound ranking and in binding affinity predictions. It is concluded that for the purposes of reproducibility and optimal performance, the most prudent procedure is to use multiple input structures for docking. The implications of these results on docking validation studies are discussed.},

Subsequent reactions of CH3 and NH2 give hydrocarbons, CH3NH2, and HCN. The extent of reaction of CH4 was measured by the ratio of the mol of CH4 reacted/mol of NH3 decompd. (DCH4/DNH3). This ratio increases with diminishing NH3 pressure at const. CH4 pressure but it remains const. if CH4/NH3 >=3. The DCH4/DNH3 ratio is independent of temp. at 156-298 K, suggesting that hot H atoms were responsible for the reaction of CH4. This postulate was confirmed by the observation that this reaction was quenched when H2 or SF6 was added to the reaction mixt. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  Abstract                 = {Photolysis of NH3 at 185 nm in the presence of a two-fold excess of CH4 results in the loss of about 0.25 mole of CH4 per mole of NH3 decomposed (delta CH4/delta NH3). The loss arises from the abstraction of hydrogen atoms from CH4 by photolytically generated hot hydrogen atoms, the presence of which is established by the constancy of delta CH4/delta NH3 between 298 and 156 K and by the quenching of the abstraction reaction when either H2 or SF6 is added. From the latter result, it can be concluded that NH3 photolysis in the H2-abundant atmosphere of Jupiter is not responsible for the presence of the carbon compounds observed there such as ethane, acetylene, and hydrogen cyanide, but may have had a role in the early atmosphere of Titan. Photolysis of PH3 with a 206 nm light source gives P2H4, which in turn is converted to a red-brown solid (P4?). The course of the photolysis is not changed appreciably when the temperatures is lowered to 157 K except that the concentration of P2H4 increases. The presence of H2 has no effect on the P2H4 yield. Photolysis of 9:1 NH3:PH3 gives a rate of decomposition of PH3 that is comparable with that observed by the direct photolysis of PH3. Comparable amounts of P2H4 and the red-brown solid are also observed. The mechanisms of these photochemical reactions together with their implications to the atmospheric chemistry of Jupiter are discussed. The structures of the compounds responsible for the wide array of colors e.g., brown, red and white, observed in the atmosphere of Jupiter have been the subject of extensive speculation. One theory suggests that these colors are due to organic materials formed by the action of either solar ultraviolet light or electric discharges on mixtures of CH4, NH3 and NH4HS in the Jovian atmosphere (Ponnamperuma, 1976; Khare et al., 1978). An alternative hypothesis is that the colors are due to inorganic compounds resulting from the photolysis of NH4HS and PH3 (Lewis and Prinn, 1970; Prinn and Lewis, 1975). In this paper we will summarize our experiments which were designed to test some of these hypotheses. [on SciFinder (R)]},

The spectra are dominated by strong CH4 absorptions, leaving only a few narrow windows for anal. All spectra show strongly the effects of atm. scattering. The 3n3 band of CH4 is at present not suitable for a reliable CH4 anal. on these objects. Rather, the column abundance is detd. by using 2 newly obsd. weak CH4 bands at 6400 and 7900 cm-1. The C/H2 mixing ratios derived from the CH4 abundances are quite similar for all the major plantes, yielding a value of .apprx. 2 * 10-3. Upper limits for a no. of gases are derived, and a depletion of NH3 and H2S in the Uranus atm. is indicated. The Uranus atm. is clear to great depths, with its upper atm. depleted in CH4. The pressure level where absorption due to CH4 becomes significant is .apprx.1.0 atm (.apprx.1 bar). By contrast, Neptune's atm. has a cloud layer of variable height whose effects can be seen throughout its IR spectrum.

  Abstract                 = {Abstract: Using a crossed laser-molecular beam scattering apparatus, these experiments photodissociate ethyl chloride at 193 nm and detect the Cl and ethyl products, resolved by their center-of-mass recoil velocities, with vacuum ultraviolet photoionization. The data determine the relative partial cross-sections for the photoionization of ethyl radicals to form C2H5+, C2H4+, and C2H3+ at 12.1 and 13.8 eV. The data also determine the internal energy distribution of the ethyl radical prior to photoionization, so we can assess the internal energy dependence of the photoionization cross-sections. The results show that the C2H4+ + H and C2H3+ + H2 dissociative photoionization cross-sections strongly depend on the photoionization energy. Calibrating the ethyl radical partial photoionization cross-sections relative to the bandwidth-averaged photoionization cross-section of Cl atoms near 13.8 eV allows us to use these data in conjunction with literature estimates of the Cl atom photoionization cross-sections to put the present bandwidth-averaged cross-sections on an absolute scale. The resulting bandwidth-averaged cross-section for the photoionization of ethyl radicals to C2H5+ near 13.8 eV is 8 ± 2 Mb. Comparison of our 12.1 eV data with high-resolution ethyl radical photoionization spectra allows us to roughly put the high-resolution spectrum on the same absolute scale. Thus, one obtains the photoionization cross-section of ethyl radicals to C2H5+ from threshold to 12.1 eV. The data show that the onset of the C2H4+ + H dissociative photoionization channel is above 12.1 eV; this result offers a simple way to determine whether the signal observed in photoionization experiments on complex mixtures is due to ethyl radicals. We discuss an application of the results for resolving the product branching in the O + allyl bimolecular reaction.},

  Abstract                 = {A review, with 70 refs., is given. One of the most important and intriguing issues concerning Titan's atm. is the methane cycle. Although the broad outline of the breakup of methane by photolytic and catalytic dissocn. to produce a suite of more complex hydrocarbons and nitriles (addnl. requiring the dissocn. of N2) is understood, several fundamental questions exist, and many details remain obscure. The spatial distribution of stratospheric hydrocarbons and nitriles was inferred from Voyager thermal IR spectra, but only at northern spring equinox. The photochem., radiative, and dynamical processes underlying this distribution are not well understood. Addnl., methane itself is important both radiatively and (possibly) dynamically in the troposphere. Voyager IR and radio-occultation measurements place some constraints on the vertical and horizontal distribution of methane, and suggest that it may be supersatd. in the upper troposphere. The presence of convective activity assocd. with methane condensation is unknown, but recent work indicates that a meager amt. of convection (compared to Earth) could be sufficient to transport heat and methane vertically and account in part for the vertical thermal structure of Titan's troposphere and provide a major source of methane for the stratosphere. The addnl. measurements provided by Cassini over a four-year period will greatly improve the understanding of these issues. Emphasis in this paper is on the combination of radio occultation measurements and thermal IR spectra, with their different sensitivities to atm. constituents. [on SciFinder (R)]},

Both rely on using average values of key parameters, such as the mean signal lifetime of a communicating civilization. A more accurate answer must take into account the distribution of stellar, planetary and biological attributes in the galaxy, as well as the stochastic nature of evolution itself. This paper outlines a method of Monte Carlo realization that does this, and hence allows an estimation of the distribution of key parameters in SETI, as well as allowing a quantification of their errors (and the level of ignorance therein). Furthermore, it provides a means for competing theories of life and intelligence to be compared quantitatively. },

Conditions within this hypothetical ocean are discussed here and compared with conditions in terrestrial biomes. These conditions, while extreme by terrestrial stds., are such that life could indeed survive. This is in stark contrast with conditions on the surface where even the simplest prebiotic reactions have half-lives of the order 107 years, and free water would only infrequently be available to participate in chem. reactions. The plausible existence of life within Titan's subterranean ocean is discussed in terms of the effects that gaseous waste products of such indigenous organisms could have on the chem. and isotopic compn. of the atm. The possibility that all of Titan's current atm. CH4 and N2 is of biogenic origin is explored from a consideration of the potential productivity of oceanic microbes. While microbial life appears to be possible, it is unlikely that the Cassini/Huygens mission will be able to distinguish any unambiguous biomarkers. The existence and possible depth of the ocean may be constrained from Cassini flyby data, but detection of life in that ocean calls for a closer examn. than the Huygens lander will afford us.

In Titan, Uranus, and Neptune, the effect on CH3D is too subtle to alter current D/H ratio determinations. In Mars, the effect can induce a large depletion of HDO, starting about one scale height above the condensation level. Although the current infrared measurements of the D/H ratio appear to be almost unaffected, the intensity of disk-averaged millimetric HDO lines can be modified by about 10%. The effect is much stronger in limb sounding and can be easily detected from orbiter observations.},

  Abstract                 = {Because dissociative recombination (DR) reactions of molecular ions are often highly exothermic, in the thermospheres of the Earth and planets DR may be a source of translationally and internally excited fragments. DR is important, therefore, for thermospheric neutral heating; if the excited fragments radiate to space, however, DR may be also a source of thermospheric cooling. DR may produce metastable fragments, which may live long enough to participate in reactions that are not available to ground state species. It is rare, however, for DR to be a significant source of minor species in their ground states. An exception appears to be the DR of CO+2, which has recently been found to produce C + O2 about 9% of the time by Seiersen et al.. Because of the significant rearrangement of bonds that must take place, the branching ratio for the latter channel has been assumed to be negligible, and DR of CO+2 has been assumed to produce mainly CO + O. In order to test the effect of including the branching ratio of CO+2 DR that produces C + O2 on the ambient densities of thermal and escaping C in planetary thermospheres,we have we have constructed revised models of the thermospheres/ionospheres of Mars and Venus. Because of space limitations, we discuss here only the high solar activity models. For Mars, we find that DR of CO+2 is the most important source of thermal C, but that the production rate of escaping C is not increased. There are important differences between the thermospheres of Venus and Mars, and we find that the inclusion of the C + O2 channel in the Venus models increases the production rate of atomic carbon in the Venus thermosphere by only 10-16%. At high altitudes on Venus, C+ is mostly produced by photoionization and electron-impact ionization of C, with some contribution from the charge transfer reaction, O+ + C - C+ + O. We compare our computed C density altitude profiles to those inferred by Paxton from Pioneer Venus Orbiter Ultraviolet Spectrometer limb scans of the atomic carbon emission features at 1561 and 1657 A. Since the most important loss process for C is reaction with O2, this allows us to to constrain the abundance of O2 in the Venus thermosphere. We then compute density profiles of C+ and compare them to those measured by the Pioneer Venus Orbiter Ion Mass Spectrometer (OIMS) (e.g., Taylor et al. [3]) to determine the rate coefficient for the charge transfer reaction of O+ to C.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;We discuss here the energy deposition of solar FUV, EUV and X-ray photons, energetic auroral particles, and pickup ions. Photons and the photoelectrons that they produce may interact with thermospheric neutral species producing dissociation, ionization, excitation, and heating. The interaction of X-rays or keV electrons with atmospheric neutrals may produce core-ionized species, which may decay by the production of characteristic X-rays or Auger electrons. Energetic particles may precipitate into the atmosphere, and their collisions with atmospheric particles also produce ionization, excitation, and heating, and auroral emissions. Auroral energetic particles, like photoelectrons, interact with the atmospheric species through discrete collisions that produce ionization, excitation, and heating of the ambient electron population. Auroral particles are, however, not restricted to the sunlit regions. They originate outside the atmosphere and are more energetic than photoelectrons, especially at magnetized planets. The spectroscopic analysis of auroral emissions is discussed here, along with its relevance to precipitating particle diagnostics. Atmospheres can also be modified by the energy deposited by the incident pickup ions with energies of eVâs to MeVâs; these particles may be of solar wind origin, or from a magnetospheric plasma. When the modeling of the energy deposition of the plasma is calculated, the subsequent modeling of the atmospheric processes, such as chemistry, emission, and the fate of hot recoil particles produced is roughly independent of the exciting radiation. However, calculating the spatial distribution of the energy deposition versus depth into the atmosphere produced by an incident plasma is much more complex than is the calculation of the solar excitation profile. Here, the nature of the energy deposition processes by the incident plasma are described as is the fate of the hot recoil particles produced by exothermic chemistry and by knock-on collisions by the incident ions.},

  Abstract                 = { Two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy was used noninvasively to monitor a fluorescent antigen during macrophage-mediated endocytosis, intracellular vacuolar encapsulation, and protease-dependent processing. Fluorescein-conjugated bovine serum albumin (FITC-BSA) served as the soluble exogenous antigen. As a relatively nonfluorescent probe in the native state, the antigen was designed to reflect sequential intracellular antigen processing events through time-dependent changes in fluorescence properties. Using two-photon lifetime imaging microscopy, antigen processing events were monitored continuously for several hours. During this time, the initial fluorescein fluorescence lifetime of 0.5 ns increased to alpha 3.0 ns. Control experiments using fluorescein conjugated poly-l-lysine and poly-d-lysine demonstrated that the increase in fluorescence parameters observed with FITC-BSA were due to intracellular proteolysis since addition of the inert d-isomer did not promote an increase in fluorescence lifetime or intensity. Comparisons of intravacuolar and extracellular FITC-dextran concentration suggested active localization of dextran in the vacuoles by the macrophage. In addition, the kinetics of degradation observed using two-photon microscopy were similar to results obtained on the flow cytometer, thus validating the use of flow cytometry for future studies. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract: This paper reviews practices in the expression of uncertainty in the experimental literature for thermodynamic property measurements with determinations of critical temperature for pure compounds used as a case study. The time period considered is from 1940 to the present, with an emphasis on results published since 1990. One hundred ninety-four articles were considered involving hundreds of compounds. The goals of this paper are to show how the nature and extent of estimations of uncertainty have changed in this time period and to document the extent to which the information provided in the articles corresponds to the recommendations of the GUM. (The GUM is the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement published in 1993 by the International Organization for Standardization, ISO. This document describes current recommended practices in this area.) It is shown that although gradual and continuous progress has been made in the reporting of uncertainty information, comprehensive uncertainty analyses remain rare, particularly with regard to the consideration of contributions arising from sample impurities. Problems in the application of experimental property results to technological challenges are discussed within the broad context of inconsistencies in the expression of uncertainty. Widespread acceptance and application of the standard methods and terminologies established within the GUM are encouraged for the benefit of experimentalists, data evaluators, and data users alike.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract: ThermoML is an XML-based approach for storage and exchange of experimental and critically evaluated thermophysical and thermochemical property data. The basic principles, scope, and description of all structural elements of ThermoML are discussed. ThermoML covers essentially all experimentally determined thermodynamic and transport property data (more than 120 properties) for pure compounds, multicomponent mixtures, and chemical reactions (including change-of-state and equilibrium). The primary focus at present is molecular compounds. Although the focus of ThermoML is properties determined by direct experimental measurement, ThermoML does cover key derived property data such as azeotropic properties, Henry's Law constants, virial coefficients (for pure compounds and mixtures), activities and activity coefficients, fugacities and fugacity coefficients, and standard properties derived from high-precision adiabatic heat-capacity calorimetry. The role of ThermoML in global data submission and dissemination is discussed with particular emphasis on the new cooperation in data processing between the Journal of Chemical and Engineering Data and the Thermodynamics Research Center (TRC) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The text of several data files illustrating the ThermoML format for pure compounds, mixtures, and chemical reactions, as well as the complete ThermoML schema text, is provided as Supporting Information. Some important issues related to characterization of thermodynamic data are beyond the scope of this paper (uncertainty specification) or are considered in generic terms only (critically evaluated data). These issues will be considered in subsequent papers in this series.},

However, mass spectra from collisionally activated dissociation (CAD) and neutralization-reionization (NR) under a wide variety conditions were indistinguishable, indicating only one isomer or same mixture of isomers. Likewise, CAD and NR spectra of C4+ and C3+ from 13CH2=CH---CH=13CH2 and CH3---13C=CH2 show complete 12C/13C scrambling. CAD cross sections are consistent with C4+-C6+ ions as mainly linear isomers and C7+ ions from cyclic precursors as mainly cyclic. CCSD(T) ab initio and B3LYP density functional theory calculations with large basis sets yielded structures and energies for a variety of cationic, neutral, and anionic carbon clusters and transition states for some cationic rearrangements. The calculated enthalpies of formation, dissociation energies, ionization energies, and electron affinities mostly agree with currently accepted experimental data. However, CCSD(T) calculations indicate adiabatic ionization energies for C3 (11.79 eV) and C4 isomers (10.48, 10.82, and 10.86 eV) that differ >1 eV from recent measurements.},

  Abstract                 = {We have solved a stationary Boltzmann transport equation to describe the ionosphere of Titan in two simple cases. The first one deals with the satellite being outside the Kronian magnetosphere on the dayside of Saturn, which happens under strong solar wind conditions. In that case, the main energy source of ionization is the solar photons. We show the effect of the photoionization and the secondary ion production for a solar zenith angle of 45[degree sign]. The electron production peaks at 25 electrons s-1 cm-3 around 1000 km. We estimate the electron density from a comprehensive chemical code. This electron density is then compared with the one computed from a simple recombination model. Finally, we determine the intensity of nitrogen emissions, which are compared to the Voyager 1 measurements. In the second case, the satellite is inside Saturn's magnetosphere. We show the effect of the ionization due to electron precipitation at night, above the polar regions. The input electron flux is measured by the Voyager probes, gathered from several instruments on board. A simple Kappa distribution is given to model a mean electron flux precipitating on Titan. We show that the electron production ranges between 1 to 5 electrons s-1 cm-3 between about 550 and 650 km. The electron production due to the photoionization above the pole is evaluated and compared to the effect of the kronian electron precipitation.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract: The reactions of singlet methylene (a1A1 1CH2) with hydrogen and deuterium have been studied by experimental and theoretical techniques. The rate coefficients for the removal of singlet methylene with H2 (k1) and D2 (k2) have been measured from 195 to 798 K and are essentially temperature-independent with values of k1 = (10.48 0.32) × 1011 cm3 molecule1 s1 and k2 = (5.98 0.34) × 1011 cm3 molecule1 s1, where the errors represent 2Ã, giving a ratio of k1/k2 = 1.75 0.11. In the reaction with H2, singlet methylene can be removed by reaction giving CH3 + H or deactivated to ground-state triplet methylene. Direct measurement of the H atom product showed that the fraction of relaxation decreased from 0.3 at 195 K to essentially zero at 398 K. For the reaction with deuterium, either H or D may be eliminated. Experimentally, the H:D ratio was determined to be 1.8 0.5 over the range 195398 K. Theoretically, the reaction kinetics has been predicted with variable reaction coordinate transition state theory and with rigid-body trajectory simulations employing various high-level, ab initio-determined potential energy surfaces. The magnitudes of the calculated rate coefficients are in agreement with experiment, but the calculations show a significant negative temperature dependence that is not observed in the experimental results. The calculated and experimental H to D ratios from the reaction of singlet methylene with D2 are in good agreement, suggesting that the reaction proceeds entirely through the formation of a long-lived methane intermediate with a statistical distribution of energy.},

  Abstract                 = {{A pyrolysis source coupled to a supersonic expansion has been used to produce the CH3 radical from two precursors, iodomethane CH3I and nitromethane CH3NO2. The relative ionization yield of CH3 has been recorded at the SOLEIL Synchrotron Radiation source in the range 9.0-11.6 eV, and its ionization threshold has been modeled by taking into account the vibrational and rotational temperature of the radical in the molecular beam. The relative photoionization yield has been normalized to an absolute cross section scale at a fixed wavelength (118.2 nm, sigma(CH3)(i) = 6.7(-1.8)(+2.4) Mb, 95\% confidence interval) in an independent laboratory experiment using the same pyrolysis source, a vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) laser, and a carefully calibrated detection chain. The resulting absolute cross section curve is in good agreement with the recently published measurements by Taatjes et al.,((1)) although with an improved signal-to-noise ratio. The absolute photoionization cross section of CH3I at 118.2 nm has also been measured to be sigma(CH3I)(i) = (48.2 +/- 7.9) Mb, in good agreement with previous electron impact measurements. Finally, the photoionization yield of the iodine atom in its ground state P-2(3/2) has been recorded using the synchrotron source and calibrated for the first time on an absolute cross section scale from our fixed 118.2 nm laser measurement, sigma(I2P3/2)(i) = 74(-23)(+33) Mb (95\% confidence interval). The ionization curve of atomic iodine is in good agreement, although with slight variations, with the earlier relative ionization yield measured by Berkowitz et al.((2)) and is also compared to an earlier calculation of the iodine cross section by Robicheaux and Greene.((3)) It is demonstrated that, in the range of pyrolysis temperature used in this work, all the ionization cross sections are temperature-independent. Systematic care has been taken to include all uncertainty sources contributing to the final confidence intervals for the reported results.}},

During Cassinis second orbit around Saturn the spacecraft performed the Ta Titan flyby (26 October 2004), at an altitude of only 1174 km. INCA data acquired during this targeted close flyby not only confirm model predictions of dominant finite ion gyroradii effects, but also reveal a much more complex interaction.

Like Earth, Titan has an atm. in which N2 is the dominant constituent. However, the temps. are low (.apprx. -180 Deg). Through the impact of solar photons or particles, mols. could form that were involved in the formation of life on Earth. Along with CH4 as the second major constituent (at an abundance of a few percent), C1-3 hydrocarbons and nitriles (HCN, C2N2, HC3N, C4N2) are known to be present in Titan's atm. Cassini-Huygens will permit the detection of adenine. [on SciFinder (R)]},

The reaction barrier is 109.847 kJ[middle dot]mol-1 at 298.15 K, which is probably too high to allow this reaction to occur in the atmosphere of Titan. The kinetic properties of the reaction are calculated at a pressure of 90 Pa and a temperature ranging from 1 to 5000 K. It is found that this reaction has a very low reaction rate under low temperature in Titan's atmosphere and that the rate decreases drastically with decreasing temperature. This result should be applicable to interstellar place with low temperature values. The results are compared with those obtained from experiments.},

The cross section of the reaction could be fitted to the expression [sigma] = 5.5 +/- 0.2 x 10-15 E-1.01 +/- 0.02, which leads to a thermal reaction rate of k(T) = 2.95 +/- 0.1 x 10-6 (T/300)-0.67 +/- 0.02 cm3 s-1.},

After a short review on experimental methods, we focus primarily upon the utility of multi-electrode ion trapping methods for addressing key problems in reaction dynamics and their applications towards gaining a better understanding of the physicochemical driving forces behind compositional development in interstellar and circumstellar environments. Temperature variable trapping techniques, combined with lasers and molecular beams are unique tools for studying state specific reactions, for ion spectroscopy and for investigating the structure and stability of complex charged objects as a function of their internal energy. Particular emphasis is given to reactions with hydrogen atoms and molecules, H-D exchange leading to isotopic fractionation, problems in hydrocarbon ion chemistry and association chemistry in rarefied environments. In the outlook, we discuss the future needs in astrochemistry in order to pave the way towards understanding the next generation of sophisticated astronomical observations and to prepare for them.},

  Abstract                 = {Saturn's large moon Titan is unique among planetary satellites in that it possesses a thick atm. and a haze layer that is opaque to visible light. This haze is believed to be composed of org. compds. produced by the photolysis of methane. It has been suggested that the photochem. products of methane photolysis, primarily ethane, would \"rain out\" over time and may produce reservoirs of liq. hydrocarbons on Titan's surface. Such material would appear very dark, with an albedo ?0.02. Such low-albedo regions have not been previously detected on Titan's surface. Here we report observations of Titan at a resoln. of 0.04 arcsec (0.02 arcsec/pixel) using the technique of speckle imaging from the 10-m Keck I Telescope. By observing Titan at specific IR wavelengths which are windows through its atm., we have made both an albedo map of Titan's surface at 1.6 and 2.1 mm and an est. of Titan's haze optical depth at these wavelengths. We clearly distinguish low-albedo features (reflectance <0.05) on Titan's surface. (c) 1999 Academic Press. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  Abstract                 = {Product branching ratios (BRs) are reported for ion-molecule reactions of state-prepared nitrogen cation (N(2)(+)) with methane (CH(4)), acetylene (C(2)H(2)). and ethylene (C(2)H(4)) at low temperature using a modified ion imaging apparatus. These reactions are performed in a supersonic nozzle expansion characterized by a rotational temperature of 40 ± 5K. For the N(2)(+) + CH(4) reaction, a BR of 0.83:0.17 is obtained for the dissociative charge-transfer (CT) reaction that gives rise to the formation of CH(3)(+) and CH(2)(+) product ions, respectively. The N(2)(+) + C(2)H(2) ion-molecule reaction proceeds through a nondissociative CT process that results in the sole formation of C(2)H(2)(+) product ions. The reaction of N(2)(+) with C(2)H(4) leads to the formation of C(2)H(3)(+) and C(2)H(2)(+) product ions with a BR of 0.74:0.26, respectively. The reported BR for the N(2)(+) + C(2)H(4) reaction is supportive of a nonresonant dissociative CT mechanism similar to the one that accompanies the N(2)(+) + CH(4) reaction. No dependence of the branching ratios on N(2)(+) rotational level was observed. In addition to providing direct insight into the dynamics of the state-prepared N(2)(+) ion-molecule reactions with the target neutral hydrocarbon molecules, the reported low-temperature BRs are also important for accurate modeling of the nitrogen-dominated upper atmosphere of Saturn's moon, Titan.},

  Abstract                 = {The origin of Titan's thick nitrogen and methane atm. is an enigma. Detection of argon would indicate that the N2 and CO now found in the atm. probably came in with ice during Titan's accretion. If there is very little argon, then we have to turn to models starting with frozen ammonia, methane and water ice, indicating a more important role for the Saturn sub-nebula, and requiring subsequent modification by photochem. Current ests. on the fraction of argon in Titan's atm. are based on indirect evidence and range from 0 to 25%. We have modeled Titan's atm. with argon as an added constituent. Using a photoelectron transport code, we detd. the photoelectron flux in a std. model Titan atm. with energy degrdn. and transport of photoelectrons due solely to N2. The calcd. photoelectron flux was then used to excite the N2, Ar, and CH4 in the upper atm. of Titan using appropriate electron impact EUV emission cross sections. Photodissociative excitation of N2, resulting in emissions by N and N+ fragments, were also included. The resulting emission profiles were used to simulate the expected brightnesses of several features in the EUV dayglow spectrum of Titan. In particular, the bright resonance line of argon at 1048 .ANG. is predicted to be present at a level of 5-10 R, depending on the assumed abundance of argon in the lower atm. of Titan. We then consider observability of the argon dayglow emission by the Berkeley spectrometer to be flown as part of the German/US Shuttle-borne ORFEUS mission. This spectrometer employs four novel spherically figured varied line-space gratings which will provide high resoln. (l/Dl > 6000) spectra from 390 to 1200 .ANG.. The calcd. integration time required for detection of argon in the atm. of Titan is about 20 h, which is, unfortunately, too long to be attempted during the 5-day ORFEUS mission. An accurate detn. of the abundance of argon on Titan will likely have to wait for the Cassini orbiter and Huygens probe to arrive at the Saturn system. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  Abstract                 = {Mars, with a rich CO2 atmosphere and Titan, with an abundance of hydrocarbons, have both been proposed as models for the atm. of early Earth. In the current atmospheres of Mars and Titan, CO2 and hydrocarbons, resp., may condense to form clouds. In this paper, we explore cloud formation processes in these two very different planetary atmospheres. Under early Martian conditions, IR scattering by CO2 clouds could have warmed the planet's surface above freezing. However, the radiative effect of the clouds depends strongly on the nucleation and growth kinetics of the cloud particles. We exptl. examine the nucleation and growth of CO2 on water ice under Martian conditions. We find that a crit. satn. of S = 1.3 is required for nucleation, corresponding to a contact parameter of m = 0.95. After nucleation, growth of CO2 proceeds rapidly without a surface kinetic barrier. Using a microphys. cloud model, our data suggest that CO2 clouds are best described as \"snow\", having a small no. of very large particles. Titan's atm. may have clouds of ethane and methane and may even support a cycle analogous to the hydrol. cycle on Earth. Alternatively, Titan's atm. may be highly supersatd. in orgs. if no suitable particles are available for nucleation. Titan's org. haze particles, dubbed tholins, may provide a suitable nucleation surface. We have prepd. a lab. sample of tholins and will be performing nucleation expts. of ethane on the tholins.

The rate of recombination of H3+ with electrons, a, plays a pivotal role in the level of ionization of interstellar plasmas. Over the past 50 years a number of studies of this recombination have been carried out, yet they did not lead to an unambiguous value of a. We report observation of the rate of de-ionization of H3+ as low as aeff \~{} 3x10-9 cm3 s-1 at hydrogen density decreasing down to 5x1010 cm-3. This implies that the dissociative recombination of H3+ under interstellar conditions is very slow with aDR$<$$<$10-8 cm3 s-1. This value is in agreement with theoretical predictions and astronomical observations, and provides an explanation of the `enigma of H3+'.},

  Abstract                 = {The recombination of H+3 ions with electrons has been studied in afterglow plasma in three different experiments. In two experiments, using the Variable Temperature Stationary Afterglow (VT-AISA) and the Variable Temperature Flowing Afterglow (VT-FALP) techniques, a decay of the electron number density was measured by an electrostatic Langmuir probe to determine the recombination rate coefficient. In the third experiment a near infrared Cavity Ring-Down Absorption Spectrometer (CRDS) was used to monitor the decay of the H+3 (v = 0) ion density during the afterglow. Measurements were carried out in helium buffer gas with small admixtures of argon and hydrogen at total pressures ranging from 150 up to 1200 Pa and at buffer gas temperatures ranging from 100 up to 330 K. In the experiments the partial number density of hydrogen was varied from 5 x 1010 up to 1 x 1016 cm[?]3 and for this broad range of hydrogen number densities effective recombination rate coefficients were obtained, which varied over three orders of magnitude from 2 x 10[?]9 cm3s[?]1 at [H2] = 5 x 1010 cm[?]3 up to 3 x 10[?]6 cm3s[?]1 at [H2] = 1 x 1016 cm[?]3. Using our experimental results we discuss possible mechanisms of recombination in hydrogen plasma in a very broad range of several parameters: buffer gas pressure, temperature, electron number density, hydrogen number density and internal excitation of recombining ions.},

Ion kinetic energy distributions were measured applying a deflection and retarding field method. The extraction of ions from the ion source was simulated fully three-dimensionally including the presence of a magnetic field for electron guidance. Thereby, discrimination factors were determined as a function of the initial ion kinetic energy. Multiplication of these factors with the ion signal leads to relative partial cross sections. By normalizing the sum of these partial cross sections to an absolute value taken from the literature, absolute partial cross sections were obtained that agree well with previous measurements where a complete collection of the product ions has been demonstrated. Moreover, with the present method, it is possible to determine cross sections that are differential with respect to the initial kinetic energy of the ion.},

PWA also measured the relief roughness during the descent and the permittivity of the surface after touchdown. The measurements and the results of the preliminary analysis are presented.

An electric signal at around 36 Hz is observed throughout the descent, but it is not yet confirmed that this emission is unambiguously related to a resonance of the ionospheric cavity. The relative dielectric constant of Titan's surface material is nearly 2 and the electric conductivity 4x10-10 S m-1. The electric properties of the surface seem to evolve after touch-down, possibly due to a local warming of the landing site by the Huygens Probe body.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe a general strategy for sampling configurations from a given distribution, not based on the standard Metropolis (Markov chain) strategy. It uses the fact that nontrivial problems in statistical physics are high dimensional and often close to Markovian. Therefore, configurations are built up in many, usually biased, steps. Due to the bias, each configuration carries its weight which changes at every step. If the bias is close to optimal, all weights are similar and importance sampling is perfect. If not, "population control" is applied by cloning/killing partial configurations with too high/low weight. This is done such that the final (weighted) distribution is unbiased. We apply this method (which is also closely related to diffusion type quantum Monte Carlo) to several problems of polymer statistics, reaction-diffusion models, sequence alignment, and percolation.},

Methane was found to be nearly satd. at Titan's tropopause, which, with other considerations, led to the hypothesis that Titan might experience a methane analog of Earth's vigorous hydrol. cycle, with clouds, rain and seas. Yet recent analyses of Voyager data indicate large areas of supersatd. methane, more indicative of dry and stagnant conditions. A resoln. to this apparent contradiction requires observations of Titan's lower atm., which was hidden from the Voyager cameras by the photochem. haze (or smog) in Titan's stratosphere. The authors report near-IR spectroscopic observations of Titan within four narrow spectral windows where the satellite's atm. is ostensibly transparent. The authors detected pronounced flux enhancements that indicate the presence of reflective methane condensation clouds in the troposphere. These clouds occur at a relatively low altitude (15 +- km), at low latitudes, and appear to cover .apprx.9 per cent of Titan's disk. [on SciFinder (R)]},

Larson's (1979) spectrum (4000-12500 cm-1) provide information on Titan's haze, possible clouds, surface albedo, and atm. abundance of H2. In the near-IR, the main features in Titan's spectrum result from absorption of solar radiation by CH4. The strength of this absorption varies considerably with wavelength, allowing study of various atm. levels down to the surface itself, by choosing specific wavelengths for anal. At 4715 cm-1, the pressure-induced S(1) fundamental band of H2 lies in the wings of CH4 bands. Based on current values for the CH4 line parameters, Titan's spectrum can be best interpreted with a vol. mixing ratio of H2 between 0.5-1.0%. The existence of an optically thin CH4 cloud layer is indicated. The optical depths detd. for Titan's haze and clouds are small enough to allow sensing of the surface of Titan at 4900, 6250, and 7700 cm-1. The most plausible interpretation of the albedos detd. at these wavenumbers suggests a surface dominated by \"dirty\" water ice. A global C2H6 ocean is not compatible with these albedos.

  Abstract                 = {The uncertainty about possible supersatn. of methane, condensation of volatile species, and the existence of clouds in Titan's lower atm. affects our understanding of photochem., the nature of the surface and the atm. thermal structure. Indeed, photochem. depends on the depth of penetration of energetic photons, affected by methane abundance. Radar and IR observations of bright surface regions have been explained by rain washing of highlands. As for the thermal profile, it is sensitive to CH4-N2 gas opacity, cloud opacity and could be influenced by latent heat exchange. A rudimentary model with no methane supersatn. and gas transport by eddy diffusion indicates a methane latent heat release of 0.2 W m-2 between 20 and 30 km altitude for a surface mole fraction of 4.4% and an eddy diffusion coeff. of 0.2 m2s-1. Description of nucleation seems to be one of the first improvements which should be included in a model of phase changes. The suspicion of difficult methane nucleation comes from anal. of Voyager IRIS spectra. Moreover, species are expected to condense to the solid phase, which excludes very efficient nucleation and condensation processes assocd. with the presence of a liq. phase, such as deliquescence. The classical theory of heterogeneous nucleation, despite its deficiencies, is employed in atm. models, owing to its general nature and relative simplicity. Yet, it requires phys. quantities for which exptl. values do not exist. It is shown how surface free enthalpies of solids and contact angles may be linked to other material properties which are within reach of lab. expts., mainly UV absorption spectra of solid phases. It is found that a value of 10-9-10-7s-1 for the \"crit. nucleation rate\" (per nucleus) is adapted to the case of Titan, though we question the ability of the crit. rate concept to make predictions for the condensation altitudes. A possible consequence of difficult methane nucleation is periodic evolution of the lower atm., on a timescale of the order of 102 years. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  Abstract                 = {Computation based on molecular models is playing an increasingly important role in biology, biological chemistry, and biophysics. Since only a very limited number of properties of biomolecular systems is actually accessible to measurement by experimental means, computer simulation can complement experiment by providing not only averages, but also distributions and time series of any definable quantity, for example, conformational distributions or interactions between parts of systems. Present day biomolecular modeling is limited in its application by four main problems: 1) the force-field problem, 2) the search (sampling) problem, 3) the ensemble (sampling) problem, and 4) the experimental problem. These four problems are discussed and illustrated by practical examples. Perspectives are also outlined for pushing forward the limitations of biomolecular modeling.},

  Abstract                 = {Quantitative computational models play an increasingly important role in modern biology. Such models typically involve many free parameters, and assigning their values is often a substantial obstacle to model development. Directly measuring in vivo biochemical parameters is difficult, and collectively fitting them to other experimental data often yields large parameter uncertainties. Nevertheless, in earlier work we showed in a growth-factor-signaling model that collective fitting could yield well-constrained predictions, even when it left individual parameters very poorly constrained. We also showed that the model had a âsloppyâ spectrum of parameter sensitivities, with eigenvalues roughly evenly distributed over many decades. Here we use a collection of models from the literature to test whether such sloppy spectra are common in systems biology. Strikingly, we find that every model we examine has a sloppy spectrum of sensitivities. We also test several consequences of this sloppiness for building predictive models. In particular, sloppiness suggests that collective fits to even large amounts of ideal time-series data will often leave many parameters poorly constrained. Tests over our model collection are consistent with this suggestion. This difficulty with collective fits may seem to argue for direct parameter measurements, but sloppiness also implies that such measurements must be formidably precise and complete to usefully constrain many model predictions. We confirm this implication in our growth-factor-signaling model. Our results suggest that sloppy sensitivity spectra are universal in systems biology models. The prevalence of sloppiness highlights the power of collective fits and suggests that modelers should focus on predictions rather than on parameters.},

  Abstract                 = {The predictivity of photochemical models of Titanâs atmosphere depends strongly on the precision and accuracy of reaction rates. For many reactions, large uncertainty results from the extrapolation of rate laws to low temperatures. A few reactions have been measured directly at temperatures relevant to Titanâs atmosphere. In the present study, we observed the consequences of the reduced uncertainty attributed to these reactions. The global predictivity of the model was improved, i.e., most species are predicted with lower uncertainty factors. Nevertheless, high uncertainty factors are still observed, and a new list of key reactions has been established.},

Evaluation of the data yielded reaction rate coefficients of: 7.0 times 10-7(T/300)-0.78 cm3 mol-1 s-1 for CH2OH+; 7.5 times 10-7(T/300)-0.70 cm3 mol-1 s-1 for CD2OD+ and 1.51 times 10-6(T/300)-0.66 cm3 mol-1 s-1 for CD2OD2+. Calculation of the branching ratios for CH2OH+ and its deuterated isotopologue gave the following results for the DR reaction channels involving C-O bond fissure: H2O + CH (2.2%) and CH2 + OH (5.5%) in the reaction of CH2OH+ as well as D2O + CD (5%) and CD2 + OD (18%) for the dissociative recombination of CD2OD+. The remainder of the reaction flux kept the C-O bond intact: 92% for CH2OH+ and 77% for CD2OD+, respectively. Other recent measurements on the CH3OH2+ ion indicate dominating bond breaking between the heavy atoms, which is in contrast to this experiment. For CD2OD2+ CO-bond breaking was observed for 43% of the reaction flux.

Combined Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 observations of temps. in the upper troposphere of Saturn indicate a seasonal asymmetry between the northern and southern hemispheres, with superposed small-scale merdional gradients. Comparison of high spatial resoln. data from the 2 hemispheres poleward of 60 Deg latitude suggests an approx. symmetry in the small-scale structure, consistent with the extension of a sym. system of zonal jets into the polar regions. Longitudinal variations of 1 to 2 K are obsd. Disk-averaged IR spectra of Titan show little change over the 9-mo interval between Voyager encounters. By combining Voyager 2 temp. measurements with ground-based geometric albedo detns., phase integrals of 0.91 +- 0.13 and 0.89 +- 0.09 were derived for Tethys and Enceladus, resp.

Sensitivity analysis is used to calculate the geometry-dependent relative importance of each input parameter for the dispersion correction. While DFT-Ds are exact at asymptotically large distances, their damping functions are shown to play a significant role in binding geometries. This is demonstrated in detail for the interlayer binding of graphite. The techniques presented allow practitioners to quickly compute error bars and to get an a posteriori estimate about the transferability of their results. They can also aid the development of future dispersion corrections.},

One of the most convenient windows lies at 1.58 mm, adjacent to the methane absorption feature at 1.62 mm. Our data span 7 consecutive nights, resulting in phase coverage of 275 Deg in longitude. The images were taken with NAOS-CONICA adaptive optics system at the VLT, using the recently commissioned Simultaneous Differential Imager mode (SDI). The combination of adaptive optics and simultaneous imaging through 3 filters sampling the methane absorption at 1.6 m reveals extraordinary details of Titan's surface. Providing views of Titan's surface at high resoln. (60 mas) is of particular topical importance, since the Cassini-Huygens mission is currently approaching the Saturn system and the Huygens probe will enter Titan's atm. in early 2005.

  Abstract                 = {The percentages of OH radicals produced in the dissociative recombination reactions of H3O(+), HCO2(+), and N2OH(+) with electrons at 300 K have been determined to be (65 + or - 15) percent, (34 + or - 8) percent, and (31 + or - 8) percent, respectively. The experiments were conducted using a flowing afterglow/Langmuir probe (FALP) apparatus modified to include spectroscopic diagnostics. In the case of H3O(+), the amount of OH produced is intermediate between the theoretical predictions of Bates (1986) and of Herbst (1978). The importance of this finding in determining the dominant oxygen containing species in dense interstellar clouds is discussed in relation to recent chemical models of these clouds. In the case of HCO2(+), it is concluded that recombination will be a significant overall loss process for HCO2(+), and thus CO2, in dense interstellar clouds for fractional electron abundances greater than about 10 to the -8th.},

  Abstract                 = {Experimental kineticists are always faced with the problem of reducing kinetic data to extract physically meaningful information. A particularly vexing problem arises when different models reproduce the data but yield different values for the physical parameters. For over forty-five years Monte Carlo simulation techniques have been used to study the statistical behavior of parameters extracted from data. Not only do these simulations provide realistic uncertainties, correlation coefficients, and confidence envelopes, but they also provide insight into the nature of the model. These insights may be obtained by viewing two-dimensional scatter plots of the fractional changes of the parameters and one-dimensional histograms of the distributions of the changes in the parameters. Monte Carlo simulations are illustrated with examples from OH+CH4 ? CH3+H2O and the high-pressure rate coefficient for methyl-methyl association. A more complex problem involves models for pressure-dependent rate coefficients in the falloff region. We have modeled methyl-methyl association with five of the most current analytic approximations for behavior in the falloff region. All of these reproduce the data to within their uncertainties. However, when Monte Carlo techniques are applied the correlations between the parameters and the nonlinear nature of their behavior become evident. We postulate that the statistical behavior of the parameters of a model may be used to distinguish one model from another and, thereby, identify those analytic approximations that hold promise for further investigation and utilization. Finally, the recent advent of high-speed workstations implies that Monte Carlo simulations should become a routine part of the analysis of kinetic data. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

  Abstract                 = {Abstract: The temperature- and pressure-dependent behavior of the cross section for optical absorption by the methyl radical is carefully considered, so we may define a criterion for selecting and correcting measurements of the rate coefficient for the recombination of methyl radicals, CH3 + CH3 C2H6. The low-temperature data of Slagle et al., Hippler et al., and Walter et al. and the high-temperature data of Glänzer et al., Hwang et al., and our latest results (previous paper in this issue) are used to define a data set which contains 217 points. Subsets of isothermal data show that the temperature dependence of the high-pressure rate coefficient may be described by the simple exponential function A exp{-T(K)/T}. Four different formulations for the pressure-dependent behavior in the falloff region are used for the global fits: (1) the asymmetric Lorentzian broadening function of Gilbert et al.; (2) the Gaussian broadening function of Wang and Frenklach; (3) the empirical "a equation" introduced by Gardiner; (4) the extension of Lindemann's expression suggested by Oref. All formulations reproduce the data, but Oref's "J equation" produces the least correlation between the best-fit parameters, the least uncertainty in these parameters, and the smallest uncertainty in the predictions. These results are k(T) = 8.78 × 10-11 exp{-T(K)/723} cm3 s-1, k0(T) = 9.04 × 10-27 cm6 s-1, and Jexp(T) = {exp[T(K)/268] - 1}2.},

In acetonitrile, tholins exhibit a broad fluorescence with a max. at 471 nm, and an excitation max. at 410 nm. The fluorescence spectrum of a water extn. displays a more complicated spectrum with multiple peaks. TLC results indicate the presence of at least three distinct fluorescent species. In addn., we obtained the two-dimensional fluorescence spectrum of tholins in water ice at 77 K, close to the surface temp. of Titan. The fluorescence of tholins in a 77 K ice matrix is red-shifted in comparison to a water soln., and undergoes a further red-shift when the water soln. is heated prior to freezing. These results suggest that a simple fluorescence probe could be used on the surface of Titan to identify sites where tholins have been mixed with water, and possibly reveal information about the extent of heating the tholin-water mixt. has undergone.

  Abstract                 = {Carbamates which decreased sporulation were: Et, Et N-Ph, Et N-phenyl-N-benzyl (I), Et N,N-di-Et, Et N-Bu, Et N,N-di-Bu, and Et N,N-di-Pr as well as Et thionocarbamate, Et N-ethylthionocarbamate, and the Et ester of 4-morpholinecarboxylic acid. Et N-Pr, iso-Pr N-Ph, and low doses of I may have enhanced sporulation. Sporulation was reduced by: 1-chloro-2-iodobenzene; monomethylnaphthalene (mixt.); hexachloronaphthalane; 1,3,5,6-tetrachloronaphthalene; polyamylnaphthalene; biphenyl; chlorinated biphenyl (mixt.); diphenylmethane; phenanthrene; 1,1,2-trichloroethane; and tetrachloroethylene. These data suggest that mitotic inhibitors inhibit sporulation. A large no. of chelating agents were tested. Except for 1-nitroso-2-naphthol, all inhibited sporulation, presumably by interfering with metal nutrition. Of 16 a,b-unsatd. ketones, 10 enhanced sporulation. In 4 that did not, the b-carbon was substituted so it could not react. In the other 2, the a- or g-carbon was so substituted that the b-carbon could be sterically hindered from reacting. Of 3 uracils, one was inactive; its b-carbon was blocked by an amino group. Of 2 coumarins, the inactive compd. had its b-carbon substituted with a Me group. Maleic hydrazide and 3-aminophthalic hydrazide acted as did the other a,b-unsatd. ketones. Ten of 12 unsatd. acids, amides, and esters enhanced sporulation. Fumaric acid did not, apparently because trans carboxyl groups hinder the reactivity of b-carbons. N-ethyl-m-crotontoluidide did not enhance sporulation. Data from tests of several derivs. of bis(4-dimethylaminophenyl)methane suggested that the amines must be tertiary to enhance sporulation. Several benzidine derivs. with no bridge between the rings were only weakly active. However, 4,4'-diaminodiphenylamine-2-sulfonic acid was also weakly active, even though it had an NH bridge. Apparently, 2 N atoms are necessary for activity, because both 4-aminobiphenyl and aniline were ineffective. Spacings between the N atoms of some compds. indicated that 10 A. is the best distance. Compds. with N-C or N-N bridges were not effective, whereas compds. with a N and a S bridge or a secondary O bridge were effective. [on SciFinder (R)]},

These are used as input data for a simple atm. model to compute the far IR radiance, brightness temp., and spectral limb function. This source of opacity alone is not capable of explaining the Voyager results. When the collision-induced CH4 is included, the results are in closer agreement in the range between 200 and 300 cm-1, suggesting that a more complete treatment of collision-induced absorption including particularly CH4-N2, N2-H2, and H2-H2 results, may provide sufficient opacity to reduce or obviate the need for opacities due to clouds or aerosols in order to explain the obsd. spectra.

  Abstract                 = {The .apprx.200 K brightness temp. detd. at 3 mm wavelength by Ulich, B. L., et al. (1978), suggests an atm. model for Titan with a 21-bar surface pressure and CH4 clouds at 100-120 km altitude. The visual limb is .apprx.200 km. The CH4 mixing ratio is 0.25% above the clouds and 7% below; the dominant gas is assumed to be N2. Thermal opacity results from pressure-induced absorption in N2, H2 (0.5%) and some cloud particles; unit opacity is reached at 600 millibars, 110 km from the surface. The radius of the solid body in this model is 2700 km, in reasonable agreement with 2600 km obtained if the d. is the same as that of Ganymede and Callisto. Deeper atmospheres can be obtained if the temp. gradient is subadiabatic or if greater CH4 abundance is assumed. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  Abstract                 = {The existence of a broad, mid-infrared absorption ranging from 1000 to 3000 cm$^{-1}$ is usually interpreted as a signature for the existence of protonated water networks. Herein, we use cryogenic mixtures of water and hydrogen fluoride (HF) and show experimental and computational evidence that similarly wide absorptions can be generated by a broad distribution of proton-shared and ion pair complexes. In the present case, we demonstrate that the broadening is mainly inhomogeneous, reflecting the fact that the topology of the first solvation shell determines the local degree of ionization and the shared-proton asymmetric stretching frequency within H2O·HF complexes. The extreme sensitivity of the proton transfer potential energy hypersurface to local hydrogen bonding topologies modulates its vibrational frequency from 2800 down to $\sim$ 1300 cm$^{-1}$, the latter value being characteristic of solvation geometries that yield similar condensed-phase proton affinities for H2O and fluoride. By linking the local degree of ionization to the solvation pattern, we are able to propose a mechanism of ionization for HF in aqueous solutions and to explain some of their unusual properties at large concentrations. However, an important conclusion of broad scientific interest is our prediction that spectral signatures that are normally attributed to protonated water networks could also reveal the presence of strong hydrogen bonds between un-ionized acids and water molecules, with important consequences to spectroscopic investigations of biologically relevant proton channels and pumps.},

  Abstract                 = {As a result of electron impact ionization and photoionization, an ionosphere should be built up at the high-altitude region of Titan's atm. From a simple consideration of the Chapman layer theory, the peak electron d. can be detd. to be ~5 * 103 cm-3 at .apprx.1200 km altitude. The complex ion-mol. reactions in the N2-CH4 atmosphere would lead to a mixt. of N2+, CH3+, C2H5+, and H2CN+ ions as the major ion species in the upper ionosphere. The new calcns. presented here also predict the presence of significant amts. of CH5+, N2H+, C2H2+, and C2H3+ ions (i.e., ni ~10-100 cm-3) near the ionospheric peak. Because of fast ion-neutral reactions with CH4 and N2, the no. d. of the Ar+ ions would not exceed a value of >10 cm-3 in the upper ionosphere if Ar has a mixing ratio .apprx.10-2 near the homopause. Interaction with the partially corotating magnetospheric plasma could lead to a significant modification of the ionospheric profile in the high altitudes. The ionospheric flow dynamics are studied in the limits of one-fluid mass-loaded flow and of diffusion-convection approxn. Both approaches show that ion-neutral friction acts as a cushion against plasma streaming effects. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  Abstract                 = {There are 2 kinds of particles in the atm. of Titan: a photochem. aerosol formed at high altitude (~400 km) through dissocn. of hydrocarbons by solar photons and charged particles of the Saturn magnetosphere slowly pptg. through the stratosphere, and particles of condensed hydrocarbons and nitriles in the lower stratosphere, below 80 km (with perhaps CH4 clouds between 10 and 40 km). New models of aerosols have been worked out. In the stratosphere, the variations of the mean radius and concn. can be described by resolving the set of microphys. equations in relation to the obsd. extinction profiles of the hazes. Another method is to use an Eulerian modeling which gives as a function of time the evolution of the size distribution for all altitudes by applying microphys. to all space. From 62 km and down into the troposphere, the strong condensation of ethane, methane and other gases modify the processes governing the evolution of aerosols. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  Abstract                 = {Compositional data often result when raw data are normalized or when data is obtained as proportions of a certain heterogeneous quantity. These conditions are fairly common in geology, economics and biology. The result is, therefore, a vector of such observations per specimen. The usual multivariate procedures are seldom adequate for the analysis of compositional data and there is a relative dearth of alternative techniques suitable for the same. The presence of covariates further adds to complexity of the situation. In this manuscript, a complete Bayesian methodology to model such data is developed and is illustrated on a real data set comprising sand, silt and clay compositions taken at various water depths in an Arctic lake. Alternative methods such as maximum likelihood estimates are compared with the proposed Bayesian estimates. Simulation based approach is adopted to ascertain adequacy of the fit. Several models are finally compared via a posterior predictive loss measure. Copyright © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {The harsh conditions on early Earth and the short timescale that life evolved indicate that life important mols. like amino acids were not produced on Earth. It has been suggested that these mols. could be produced in the interstellar medium (ISM) or on icy bodies and subsequently be deposited on Earth. Under intense galactic cosmic irradn., simple mols. in interstellar ices like nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane are chem. processed to form astrobiol. important mols. such as glycine, as detected in our lab by electron irradn. of a methylamine: carbon dioxide mixt. The goal of this study is to follow the reaction pathway of precursors to amino acids such as methylamine or isomers of hydrogen cyanide by irradiating an ice mixt. of nitrogen: methane at temps. and pressures relevant to the ISM. This work was also done at higher temps. for relevance to tholin prodn. on Titan in prepn. for the arrival of the Huygens Probe. Acknowledgments: PPARC, U. of Hawaii at Manoa, NASA- Astrobiol.

  Abstract                 = {The methodology of interacting sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers is introduced. SMC samplers are methods for sampling from a sequence of densities on a common measurable space using a combination of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and sequential importance sampling/resampling (SIR) methodology. One of the main problems with SMC samplers when simulating from trans-dimensional, multimodal static targets is that transition kernels do not mix which leads to low particle diversity. In such situations poor Monte Carlo estimates may be derived. To deal with this problem an interacting SMC approach for static inference is introduced. The method proceeds by running SMC samplers in parallel on, initially, different regions of the state space and then moving the corresponding samples onto the entire state space. Once the samplers reach a common space the samplers are combined and allowed to interact. The method is intended to increase the diversity of the population of samples. It is established that interacting SMC admit a Feynman-Kac representation; this provides a framework for the convergence results that are developed. In addition, the methodology is demonstrated on a trans-dimensional inference problem in Bayesian mixture modelling and also, using adaptive methods, a mixture modelling problem in population genetics.},

  Abstract                 = {Bombardment of Titan by Uranus-Neptune planetesimals and/or fragments of a disrupted Hyperion progenitor supplied more than enough energy to drive vigorous atm. shock chem. Chem. equil. modeling of the shock products in simulated atms. indicates that impact energy has produced large amts. of N2 and org. compds. over Titan's history. The mol fraction of org. compds. in the shocked gas mixt. (at 1200-2500K and 10-1-103 bar) reaches a max. of .apprx.3% in a current Titan mixt. and 12% in a primordial CH4, NH3-rich mixt. Atm. water mixing ratio controls the org. yield in shock reactions, but its limiting effect may have been reduced by cold-trapping of water in a cooling atm. Kinetic inhibition of graphite formation in the shocked gas enhanced the yield of radicals and orgs. The resulting mixt. of carbonaceous soot and condensed hydrocarbons subsequently settled onto the surface; the depth of the generated layer was on the order of hundreds of meters. Impact shock energy was capable of converting massive amts. of NH3 to N2 early in Titan history, over twice the present atm. and 1.5 times the total ocean-atm. inventory of N2. Shock conversion of NH3 into N2 bypasses the difficulties of other schemes of N2 prodn. and may have been of singular importance in Titan's atm. evolution. [on SciFinder (R)]},

The spectra extend from 300-1050 nm wavelength. The spectral resoln. is 0.4 nm between 520 and 995 nm, and 1 nm elsewhere. The accuracy of the albedo calibration is 4%. UBV magnitudes were also detd. Raman scattering was quantified for each planet. CH4 and NH3 bands are at 0.4 nm spectral resoln., including a new band at 930 nm wavelength which is probably due to NH3. Maps of the absorptions variation across the disks of Jupiter and Saturn are displayed. Saturn's spectrum is undisturbed by light from its rings due to the edge-on geometry during the observations. The albedo of Uranus near 1 mm wavelength has dropped almost 10% between 1993 and 1995, while there was no change in the UV. The signature of light from Titan's surface yielded a path length of 4 km-am of CH4 in Titan's atm. The temp. dependence of the width of the 890-nm CH4 band was used to measure temp. variations at three altitude levels, resulting in the first temp. maps of Jupiter and Saturn based on reflected sunlight. Jupiter displays a banded temp. structure with some discrete features of a few Kelvin amplitude. Saturn's north-south temp. asymmetry has reversed since the Voyager observations.

  Abstract                 = {Observations are made of Saturn's atm. in the visible and near-IR (460-940 nm) including 4 hydrogen quadrupole lines, 17 methane absorption bands ranging over 3 orders of magnitude in absorption strength, an ammonia absorption band, and the abs. calibrated continuum spectrum. All observations have complete coverage of Saturn's disk, in latitude as well as in center-to-limb position. A new method describing center-to-limb information is presented. The accuracy of the data is comparable to or better than that of previous data. This data set gives a quite complete description of Saturn's atm. in the visible and near IR at the spatial resoln. of ground-based observations. The main data were acquired in 1988, but small changes between 1986 and 1989 were detd. also. Weak absorption features of hydrogen, methane, and ammonia show a significant enhancement in the North Polar Region compared to the rest of the planet. An atm. model is given which fits all observations within estd. errors. It has clear gas at the top of the atm., an extended haze layer, and a reflective cloud at the bottom. Pressure levels and the haze optical depth were detd. as a function of latitude. The single-scattering albedo spectrum of the particles (most likely ammonia ice crystals) is also given for each latitude. The methane mixing ratio is (3.0 +- 0.6) * 10-3, the ammonia mixing ratio is (1.2 + 0.8/-0.6) * 10-3 below the ammonia condensation level. A cold temp. methane absorption spectrum is detd. under the assumption that methane band strengths are temp. invariant. It indicates that the absorption coeffs. in band centers are typically 20-30% stronger than at room temp. This spectrum should be useful in the interpretation of methane observations of all the giant planets and Titan. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  Abstract                 = {We present a number of near-exact, nonrelativistic, BornâOppenheimer reference data sets for the parametrization of more approximate methods (such as DFT functionals). The data were obtained by means of the W4 ab initio computational thermochemistry protocol, which has a 95% confidence interval well below 1 kJ/mol. Our data sets include W4-08, which are total atomization energies of over 100 small molecules that cover varying degrees of nondynamical correlations, and DBH24-W4, which are W4 theory values for Truhlarâs set of 24 representative barrier heights. The usual procedure of comparing calculated DFT values with experimental atomization energies is hampered by comparatively large experimental uncertainties in many experimental values and compounds errors due to deficiencies in the DFT functional with those resulting from neglect of relativity and finite nuclear mass. Comparison with accurate, explicitly nonrelativistic, ab initio data avoids these issues. We then proceed to explore the performance of B2x-PLYP-type double hybrid functionals for atomization energies and barrier heights. We find that the optimum hybrids for hydrogen-transfer reactions, heavy-atoms transfers, nucleophilic substitutions, and unimolecular and recombination reactions are quite different from one another: out of these subsets, the heavy-atom transfer reactions are by far the most sensitive to the percentages of HartreeâFock-type exchange y and MP2-type correlation x in an (x,ây) double hybrid. The (42,72) hybrid B2K-PLYP, as reported in a preliminary communication, represents the best compromise between thermochemistry and hydrogen-transfer barriers, while also yielding excellent performance for nucleophilic substitutions. By optimizing for best overall performance on both thermochemistry and the DBH24-W4 data set, however, we find a new (36,65) hybrid which we term B2GP-PLYP. At a slight expense in performance for hydrogen-transfer barrier heights and nucleophilic substitutions, we obtain substantially better performance for the other reaction types. Although both B2K-PLYP and B2GP-PLYP are capable of 2 kcal/mol quality thermochemistry, B2GP-PLYP appears to be the more robust toward nondynamical correlation and strongly polar character. We additionally find that double-hybrid functionals display excellent performance for such problems as hydrogen bonding, prototype late transition metal reactions, pericyclic reactions, prototype cumuleneâpolyacetylene system, and weak interactions.},

The sensor utilizes a dual radio frequency quadrupole mass analyzer with a mass range of 1-99 amu, two electron multipliers operated in pulse-counting mode to cover the dynamic range required and two sep. ion sources. A closed ion source measures non-surface reactive neutral species which have thermally accommodated to the inlet walls such as N2 and CH4. An open ion source allows direct beaming ions or chem. active neutral species such as N and HCN to be measured without surface interaction. The instrument can alternate between these three different modes (closed neutral, open ion and open neutral). Characterization and calibration of each of these three modes is done using a low energy ion beam, a neutral mol. beam and a neutral thermal gas source. An onboard flight computer is used to control instrument operating parameters in accordance with pre-programmed sequences and to package the telemetry data. The sensor is sealed and maintained in a vacuum prior to launch to provide a clean environment for measurement of neutral species when it is opened to the ambient atm. after orbit insertion. The instrument is provided by NASA/Goddard Spaceflight Center, Code 915. Operation of the instrument and data anal. will be carried out by a Science Team. [on SciFinder (R)]},

A one-dimensional MHD model was developed, for radial distances of 1.3-2.0 Titan radii (RT), to study the dynamics of H2CN+, CnHm+ (n,m > 2), C2H5+, and CH5+, in the ramside ionosphere of Titan. For the case of a dayside ramside ionosphere (solar zenith angle of 60 Deg) the authors found that the external magnetospheric plasma interacting with Titan's ionosphere produced a very broad region of ionospheric magnetic field whose peak field strength was ~26 nT. The ionosphere was magnetized well below the ionospheric peak, allowing ionizing Saturnian magnetospheric electrons access to this region. The sources of ionization and the electron temp. profiles incorporated into the model depend on the relative locations of Titan, Saturn, and the Sun. The calcd. electron and ion d. profiles as well as the magnetic field profile also depend on the relative positions of Titan, Saturn, and the Sun. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  Abstract                 = {Many bodies in the outer Solar System display the presence of low-albedo materials. These materials, evident on the surface of asteroids, comets, Kuiper Belt objects, and their intermediate evolutionary step (Centaurs) are related to macromol. carbon-bearing materials such as polycyclic arom. hydrocarbons and org. materials such as methanol and related light hydrocarbons, embedded in a dark, refractory, photoprocessed matrix. Many planetary rings and satellites around the outer gaseous planets display such component materials. One example, Saturn's largest satellite, Titan, whose atm. is comprised of around 90% mol. nitrogen N2 and less than 10% methane CH4, displays this kind of low reflectivity material in its atm. haze. These materials were first recorded during the Voyager 1 and 2 flybys of Titan and showed up as an optically thick pinkish orange haze layer. These materials are broadly classified into a chem. group whose lab. analogs are termed \"tholins\", after the Greek word for \"muddy\". Their analogs are produced in the lab. via the irradn. of gas mixts. and ice mixts. by radiation simulating Solar UV photons or keV charged particles simulating particles trapped in Saturn's magenetosphere. Fair analogs of Titan tholin are produced by bombarding a 9:1 mixt. of N2:CH4 with charged particles and its match to observations of both the spectrum and scattering properties of the Titan haze is very good over a wide range of wavelengths. In this paper, we describe the historical background of lab. research on this kind of org. matter and how our lab. investigations of Titan tholin compare. We comment on the probable existence of polycyclic arom. hydrocarbons in the Titan Haze and how biol. and nonbiol. racemic amino acids produced from the acid hydrolysis of Titan tholins make these complex org. compds. prime candidates in the evolution of terrestrial life and extraterrestrial life in our own Solar System and beyond. Finally, we also compare the spectrum and scattering properties of our resulting tholin mixts. with those obsd. on Centaur 5145 Pholus and the dark hemisphere of Saturn's satellite Iapetus in order to demonstrate the widespread distribution of similar orgs. throughout the Solar System.

Characterization of both the mol. and the submicrometer components of the haze is therefore vital for understanding the global properties of Titan. We have carried out a Titan tholin synthesis expt. and measured the time variation of the IR spectrum of the product as a thin film developed. Also, to examine the possibility of oxygen contamination, we compared the IR spectrum of the tholin film with that of a tholin film exposed to dry air and lab. air. The objective of this study is to understand the chem. processes related to how simple org. mols. are processed into more complex haze particles. The progressive development of features characteristic of amines, arom. and aliph. hydrocarbons, and nitriles in the exptl. mixt. is clear. Of particular interest is the formation of arom. rings after only a few seconds of glow discharge, indicating that these compds. appear to be intermediates between simple haze mols. and microphys. aerosols. The early dominance of arom. ring structures is accompanied during the later stages of the expt. by the appearance of nitrile and amine compds. This time-dependent succession of chem. structures provides vital clues to the possible chem. formation pathways of Titan haze aerosols. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  Abstract                 = {An org. heteropolymer (Titan tholin) was produced by continuous dc discharge through a 0.9 N/0.1 CH4 gas mixt. at 0.2 mbar pressure, roughly simulating the cloudtop atm. of Titan. Treatment of this tholin with 6N HCl yielded 16 amino acids by gas chromatog. after derivatization to N-trifluroacetyl iso-Pr esters on 2 different capillary columns. Identifications were confirmed by gas chromatog./mass spectroscopy. Glycine, aspartic acid, and a- and b-alanine were produced in greatest abundance; the total yield of amino acids was .apprx.10-2, approx. equal to the yield of urea.

  Abstract                 = {C. N. Matthews (1992) has proposed that HCN \"polymer\" is ubiquitous in the solar system. The authors apply vacuum deposition and spectroscopic techniques previously used on synthetic org. heteropolymers (tholins), kerogens, and meteoritic org. residues to the measurement of the optical consts. of poly-HCN in the wavelength range 0.05-40 mm. These measurements allow quant. comparison with spectrophotometry of org.-rich bodies in the outer solar system. In a specific test of Matthews' hypothesis, poly-HCN fails to match the optical consts. of the haze of the Saturnian moon, Titan, in the visible and near-IR, derived from astronomical observations and std. models of the Titan atm. In contrast, a tholin produced from a simulated Titan atm. matches within the probable errors. Poly-HCN is much more N-rich than Titan tholin. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  Abstract                 = {Copulas have attracted significant attention in the recent literature for modeling multivariate observations. An important feature of copulas is that they enable us to specify the univariate marginal distributions and their joint behavior separately. The copula parameter captures the intrinsic dependence between the marginal variables and it can be estimated by parametric or semiparametric methods. For practical applications, the so called inference function for margins (IFM) method has emerged as the preferred fully parametric method because it is close to maximum likelihood (ML) in approach and is easier to implement. The purpose of this paper is to compare the ML and IFM methods with a semiparametric (SP) method that treats the univariate marginal distributions as unknown functions. In this paper, we consider the SP method proposed by Genest et al. [1995. A semiparametric estimation procedure of dependence parameters in multivariate families of distributions. Biometrika 82(3), 543-552], which has attracted considerable interest in the literature. The results of an extensive simulation study reported here show that the ML/IFM methods are nonrobust against misspecification of the marginal distributions, and that the SP method performs better than the ML and IFM methods, overall. A data example on household expenditure is used to illustrate the application of various data analytic methods for applying the SP method, and to compare and contrast the ML, IFM and SP methods. The main conclusion is that, in terms of statistical computations and data analysis, the SP method is better than ML and IFM methods when the marginal distributions are unknown which is almost always the case in practice.},

Various kinds of expts. have been performed to examine how these org. compds. were abiotically synthesized in simulated primitive terrestrial and extraterrestrial environments. Miller found that amino acids were easily formed by spark discharges in a mixt. of methane, ammonia, hydrogen and water. Nowaday, however, the primitive earth atm. is believed to be less reducing, like a mixt. of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen and water. It has been difficult to form org. compds. from this kind of gas mixt. with conventional energies. The authors found that amino acids could be formed from this gas mixt. if high energy protons (major constituents of cosmic rays) were used as an energy source. Hydrothermal vent environments are another possible site for abiotic formation of bioorg. compds. Org. compds. have been found in extraterrestrial environments, such as in Jupiter, Titan and comets. Amino acid precursors were formed when mixts. simulating Jovian atm., Titan atm., or cometary nuclei (aggregates of interstellar dust particles with ice mantles) were irradiated with high energy protons. Org. compds. carried by comets may have been essential sources for the first organisms on primitive earth. Planetary missions are quite important to see how chem. evolution goes in prebiotic environments.

  Abstract                 = {Terrestrial organisms were supposed to be abiogenetically born in primordial sea about 4 billion years ago, using org. compds. in seawater. We performed expts. simulating the environments of primitive planets or interstellar dusts to examine possible formation of bioorg. compds. essential for the first organisms. When a gas mixt. of Titan-type, which contained methane and nitrogen, was exposed to a spark discharge, such org. compds. as hydrocarbons, \"amino acid precursors,\" and some nucleic acid bases like cytosine were formed: The amino acid precursors are compds. which give amino acids after acid hydrolysis. If a gas mixt. of carbon monoxide, nitrogen and water (\"mildly-reduced gas mixt.\") was used, spark discharges gave only trace amt. of the amino acid precursors. The same type of gas mixt. was irradiated with high energy particles, the amino acid precursors were formed in high yield, together with uracil and imidazole. Some of the amino acid precursors had mol. wt. of several hundreds, thus they might be condensates of amino acids. Amino acid precursors were also formed when a simulated ice mantle (10 K) of interstellar dust particles was irradiated with high energy particles. These results suggest that (i) cosmic ray-induced formation of bioorg. compds. was important if the primitive terrestrial atm. was mildly reduced, (ii) exogenous org. compds. delivered by bodies like comets could not be negligible, particularly if the primitive terrestrial atm. was non-reduced, and (iii) further simulation studies on abiotic syntheses of bioorg. compds. will be required to evaluate \"the RNA-world hypothesis\" and \"the Oligomer-world hypothesis\".

The amt. of amino acids was proportional to the energy deposit to the system. Various kinds of simulated planetary atmospheres, such as \"Titan type\" and \"Jovian type\", were also irradiated with high energy protons, and gave amino acids in the hydrolyzed products.

The authors examd. energetics of org. formation in simulated planetary atmospheres. Gas mixts. including a C-source (carbon monoxide or methane) and a N-source (nitrogen or ammonia) were irradiated with the following: High energy protons or electrons from accelerators, gamma-rays from 60Co, UV light from a deuterium lamp, and soft X-rays or UV light from an electron synchrotron. Amino acids were detected in the products of particles, gamma-rays and soft X-rays irradn. from each gas mixt. examd. UV light gave, however, no amino acid precursors in the gas mixt. of carbon monoxide, nitrogen and nitrogen. It gave only a trace of them in the gas mixt. of carbon monoxide, ammonia and water or that of methane, nitrogen and water. Yield of amino acid precursors by photons greatly depended on their wavelength. These results suggest that nitrogen-contg. org. compds. like amino acid precursors were formed chiefly with high energy particles, not UV photons, in Titan or primitive Earth/Mars atmospheres where ammonia is not available as a predominant N-source.

  Abstract                 = {We have investigated the abundances of Titan's stratospheric oxygen compounds using 0.5 cm-1 resolution spectra from the Composite Infrared Spectrometer on the Cassini orbiter. The CO abundance was derived for several observations of far-infrared nadir spectra, taken at a range of latitudes (75[degree sign] S-35[degree sign] N) and emission angles (0[degree sign]-60[degree sign]), using rotational lines that have not been analysed before the arrival of Cassini at Saturn. The derived volume mixing ratios for the different observations are mutually consistent regardless of latitude. The weighted mean CO volume mixing ratio is 47+/-8 ppm if CO is assumed to be uniform with latitude. H2O could not be detected and an upper limit of 0.9 ppb was determined. CO2 abundances derived from mid-infrared nadir spectra show no significant latitudinal variations, with typical values of 16+/-2 ppb. Mid-infrared limb spectra at 55[degree sign] S were used to constrain the vertical profile of CO2 for the first time. A vertical CO2 profile that is constant above the condensation level at a volume mixing ratio of 15 ppb reproduces the limb spectra very well below 200 km. This is consistent with the long chemical lifetime of CO2 in Titan's stratosphere. Above 200 km the CO2 volume mixing ratio is not well constrained and an increase with altitude cannot be ruled out there.},

The Titan cloud consists, most probably, of a rather dispersed and vertically elongated haze, consisting of small fractions of solid CH4 particles. The 3.5- and 8-mm absorption bands of the haze are overlapped by absorption bands of the atm. gas components, and therefore have no significant effect on the radiative properties of the atm. Heating of the below-cloud layer of the Titan atm. is caused by absorption of solar radiation by numerous CH4 bands in the visible and near-IR region.

  Abstract                 = {CH4 and N2 are partially miscible in the condensed phase. Although there are exptl. data on the vapor-liq. equil. of CH34 + N2 mixts. at the low temps. characterizing much of Titan's lower atm., in many cases only the temp., total vapor pressure, and compn. of the liq. phase have been measured. The compn. of the vapor phase is uniquely detd. as a consequence of the Gibbs phase rule, and the vapor compn. is computed for these data by integration of the Gibbs-Duhem equation. The thermodn. consistency of published measurements and calcns. of the vapor phase is examd. Using the profile of Titan's atm. temp. derived from Voyager radio occultation measurements, the satd. mole fraction of gaseous CH4 is computed as a function of altitude ? the 700-mbar level. It lies approx. halfway between that computed from Raoult's Law for a gas in equil. with an ideal soln. of liq. Ni and CH4 and that for a gas in equil. with pure liq. CH4. Above this level, the equil. condensed phase will freeze. If, however, a supercooled liq. phase is assumed the exptl. measurements can be extrapolated to a lower pressure and temp., and the vertical profile of gaseous CH4 can be extended to the cold trap near 344 mbar, where the satd. mole fraction of tropospheric CH4 is a min. If uniform mixing of CH4 above this level is assumed, the occultation measurements may be adjusted for the presence of this constituent in the stratosphere. At the cold trap the mole fraction of CH4 in equil. with supercooled droplets in a N + CH4 atmosphere is 0.017 +- 0.001. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  Abstract                 = {A global-mean model of coupled neutral and ion chemistry on Titan has been developed. Unlike the previous coupled models, the model involves ambipolar diffusion and escape of ions, hydrodynamic escape of light species, and calculates the H2 and CO densities near the surface that were assigned in some previous models. We tried to reduce the numbers of species and reactions in the model and remove all species and reactions that weakly affect the observed species. Hydrocarbon chemistry is extended to C12H10 for neutrals and C10H+11 for ions but does not include PAHs. The model involves 415 reactions of 83 neutrals and 33 ions, effects of magnetospheric electrons, protons, and cosmic rays. UV absorption by Titan's haze was calculated using the Huygens observations and a code for the aggregate particles. Hydrocarbon, nitrile, and ion chemistries are strongly coupled on Titan, and attempt to calculate them separately (e.g., in models of ionospheric composition) may result in significant error. The model densities of various species are typically in good agreement with the observations except vertical profiles in the stratosphere that are steeper than the CIRS limb data. (A model with eddy diffusion that facilitates fitting to the CIRS limb data is considered as well.) The CO densities are supported by the O+ flux from Saturn's magnetosphere. The ionosphere includes a peak at 80 km formed by the cosmic rays, steplike layers at 500-700 and 700-900 km and a peak at 1060 km (SZA = 60°). Nighttime densities of major ions agree with the INMS data. Ion chemistry dominates in the production of bicyclic aromatic hydrocarbons above 600 km. The model estimates of heavy positive and negative ions are in reasonable agreement with the Cassini results. The major haze production is in the reactions C6H + C4H2, C3N + C4H2, and condensation of hydrocarbons below 100 km. Overall, precipitation rate of the photochemical products is equal to 4-7 kg[thin space]cm-2[thin space]Byr-1 (50-90 m[thin space]Byr-1 while the global-mean depth of the organic sediments is ~3 m). Escape rates of methane and hydrogen are 2.9 and 1.4 kg[thin space]cm-2[thin space]Byr-1, respectively. The model does not support the low C/N ratio observed by the Huygens ACP in Titan's haze.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider Pluto's photochem. using a background model for a hydrodynamically escaping atm. by Krasnopolsky [1999]. Some adjustments are made in the basic continuity equation and in the boundary conditions to account for hydrodynamic flow in the atm. We model the photochem. for 44 neutral and 23 ion species. Because of the high methane mixing ratio, Pluto's photochem. is more similar to that of Titan than that of Triton. Charge exchange between N2+ and CH4 significantly reduces the prodn. of at. nitrogen. The most abundant photochem. products are C2H2 (3*1017), C4H2 (1017), HCN (6*1016), H2 (4*1016), C2H4 (4*1016), HC3N (3.4*1016), C2H6 (2*1016), C3H2 (9*1015), and C3H4 (8*1015, all in cm-2). In addn. to the parent N2, CH4, and CO mols. which absorb photons with l<145 nm, these products absorb almost completely photons with l<185 nm, therefore significantly increasing the no. of dissocn. events. Photochem. losses of the parent species are much smaller than their escape. Pptn. rates are the highest for C2H2, C4H2, HC3N, HCN, C2H6, and C2H4 (65, 58, 23, 14, 9, and 6 g cm-2 Byr-1, resp., reduced by a factor of 3 to account for seasonal variations).

The electron d. reaches a max. of 800 cm-3 at 2250 km. The most abundant ions are HCNH+, C3H3+, and C3H5+.

Previous models of the gas-phase chem. of impacts predicted that the terrestrial planets' atmospheres should be initially dominated by CO/CO2, N2, and H2O. CH4 was not predicted to form in impacts because gas-phase reactions in the explosion quench at temps. .apprx.2000 K, at which point all of the carbon is locked in CO. We argue that the dust that condenses out in the wake of a large comet impact is likely to have very effective catalytic properties, opening up reaction pathways to convert CO and H2 to CH4 and CO2, at temps. of a few hundred K. Together with CO2, CH4 is an important greenhouse gas that was invoked to compensate for the lower luminosity of the Sun .apprx.4 Gyr ago. Here, we show that heterogeneous (gas-solid) reactions on freshly-recondensed dust in the impact cloud may provide a plausible non-biol. mechanism for reducing CO to CH4 before and during the emergence of life on Earth, and perhaps Mars as well. These encouraging results emphasize the importance of future research into the kinetics and catalytic properties of astrophys. condensates or \"smokes\" and also more detailed models to det. the conditions in impact-generated dust clouds.

The conventional method of obtaining decay-associated spectra fails when the lifetimes of the fluorophore in the membrane phase and in the aqueous phase are very close to each other. This paper describes a global analysis method which takes advantage of the known spectrum and lifetime of the dye in the aqueous phase. This method is used to identify the spectra for two fluorescent species (lifetimes, 0.84 and 1.97 ns) of the dye DODCI in EggPC vesicle membranes by keeping the spectrum and lifetime (0.68 ns) of the dye in the aqueous phase as fixed parameters. The structural identity of the two membrane-bound dye species was established by the effect of refractive index and/or viscosity of the aqueous medium on the lifetimes.},

Possible lightning on Saturn's moon Titan with a dense nitrogen-methane atm. may provide an addnl. energy for the formation of some trace species including prebiotic mols. in the troposphere, where other chem. processes are inactive. Although thunderclouds may be a rare phenomenon on Titan, a rapid development of a thick, extensive CH4 cloud in the troposphere would attract a high no. of free electrons, which are present due to the low abundance of electrophilic species. The entirely neg. charge of the cloud may cause temporary max. elec. fields in excess of the breakdown field to initiate Earth-like cloud-to-ground lightning flashes in the lowest 20 km of Titan's atm. It is suggested that the electromagnetic energy radiated by possible lightning should be sufficient to produce some long-lived hydrocarbons and nitriles, preferentially at low latitudes, where the CH4 abundance and the lightning frequency may be higher than at higher latitudes.

  Abstract                 = {Previous modeling by Banaszkiewicz et al. (2000a,b) showed that the CH4 thermospheric mixing ratio on Titan could vary as much as 35-40% due to ion-neutral chem. reactions. A new vertical methane profile has been computed by simultaneously modifying the stratospheric methane mixing ratio and the K(z) previously considered by Lara et al. (1996) and Banaszkiewicz et al. (2000a,b). A satisfactory fit of the methane thermospheric abundance and stratospheric mixing ratio of other minor constituents is achieved by placing the homopause at .apprx.1000 km and increasing the methane stratospheric mixing ratio (qCH4) up to 3.8%. The new proposed eddy diffusion coeff. steadily rises from 1*107 cm2 s-1 at 700 km to 1*1010 cm2 s-1 at 1500 km, whereas the stratospheric values are in the range (4-20)*103 cm2 s-1. Other likely ionization sources that can influence the methane distribution are (i) a metallic ion layer produced by micrometeoroid infall and (ii) frequent X-rays solar flares. Anal. of the effects of these ionization sources on the methane distribution indicates that, unlike previously assumed, CH4 can suffer considerable variations. These variations, although proved in this work, must be cautiously regarded since several assumptions have to be made on the rate of N2 and CH4 ionization by the processes previously mentioned. Hence, these results are only indicative of methane sensitivity to ionospheric chem. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  Abstract                 = {It is suggested that the incorporation of HCN in Titan's atm. haze may be an important process affecting the HCN profile and the C/N ratio in Titan's haze. By introducing a loss to the haze term for HCN (i.e. a prodn. term of poly-HCN) in the photochem. model of Lara et al. (1996), we have improved the model's ability to simultaneously reproduce the obsd. HCN and C2 hydrocarbon profiles in Titan's lower stratosphere. The loss rate of HCN by this process may be a few times 108 cm-2 s-1. The calcd. C/N ratio in the haze, assuming that the haze is primarily produced from C6H2, C8H2, and poly-HCN, is approx. equal to 2, in agreement with the compn. of lab. tholin analogs. [on SciFinder (R)]},

On the other hand, the striking reactivity of C$_{16}$H$_9^+$ toward atoms, compared to the relative unreactivity of phenylium and naphthylium cations, is believed to result from the triplet nature of this ion in its ground state.

  Abstract                 = {Benzene has recently been observed in the atmosphere of Jupiter, Saturn and also Titan. This compound is required as a precursor for larger aromatic species (PAHs) that may be part of aerosol particles. Several photochemical models have tried to reproduce the observed quantities of benzene in the atmospheres of Jupiter (both low- and high-latitudes regions), Saturn and Titan. In this present work, we have conducted a sensitivity study of benzene and PAHs formation, using similar photochemical schemes both for Titan and Jupiter (low-latitudes conditions). Two different photochemical schemes are used, for which the modeled composition fairly agrees with observational constraints, both for Jupiter and Titan. Some disagreements are specific to each atmospheric case, which may point to needed improvements, especially in kinetic data involved in the corresponding chemical cycles. The observed benzene mole fraction in Titan's stratosphere is reproduced by the model, but in the case of Jupiter, low-latitudes benzene abundance is only 3% of the observed column density, which may indicate a possible influence of latitudinal transport, since abundance of benzene is much higher in auroral regions. Though, the photochemical scheme of C6 compounds at temperature and pressure conditions of planetary atmospheres is still very uncertain. Several variations are therefore done on key reactions in benzene production. These variations show that benzene abundance is mainly sensitive to reactions that may affect the propargyl radical. The effect of aerosol production on hydrocarbons composition is also tested, as well as possible heterogenous recombination of atomic hydrogen in the case of Titan. PAHs are a major pathway for aerosol production in both models. The mass production profiles for aerosols are discussed for both Titan and Jupiter. Total production mass fluxes are roughly three times the one expected by observational constraints in both cases. Such comparative studies are useful to bring more constraints on photochemical models.},

  Abstract                 = {Using a one-dimensional model, we investigate the hydrogen budget and escape to space in Titan's atmosphere. Our goal is to study in detail the distributions and fluxes of atomic and molecular hydrogen in the model, while identifying sources of qualitative and quantitative uncertainties. Our study confirms that the escape of atomic and molecular hydrogen to space is limited by the diffusion through the homopause level. The H distribution and flux inside the atmosphere are very sensitive to the eddy diffusion coefficient used above altitude 600 km. We chose a high value of this coefficient 1 × 108 cm2 s-1 and a homopause level around altitude 900 km. We find that H flows down significantly from the production region above 500 km to the region [300-500] km, where it recombines into H2. Production of both H and H2 also occurs in the stratosphere, mostly from photodissociation of acetylene. The only available observational data to be compared are the escape rate of H deduced from Pioneer 11 and IUE observations of the H torus 1-3 × 109 cm-2 s-1 and the latest retrieved value of the H2 mole fraction in the stratosphere: (1.1 ± 0.1) × 10-3. Our results for both of these values are at least 50-100% higher, though the uncertainties within the chemical schemes and other aspects of the model are large. The chemical conversion from H to H2 is essentially done through catalytic cycles using acetylene and diacetylene. We have studied the role of this diacetylene cycle, for which the associated reaction rates are poorly known. We find that it mostly affects C4 species and benzene in the lower atmosphere, rather than the H profile and the hydrogen budget. We have introduced the heterogenous recombination of hydrogen on the surface of aerosol particles in the stratosphere, and this appears to be a significant process, comparable to the chemical processes. It has a major influence on the H distribution, and consequently on several other species, especially C3H4, C4H2 and C6H6. Therefore, this heterogenous process should be taken into account when trying to understand the stratospheric distribution of these hydrocarbons.},

Although our goal here is not to build a detailed kinetic model for this transition, we propose parameterizations to est. the prodn. rates of these macromols., their C/N and C/H ratios, and the loss of parent mols. (C2H2, HCN, HC3N and other nitriles, and C6H6) from the gas phase to the haze. We use a one-dimensional photochem. model of Titan's atm. to est. the formation rate of precursor macromols. We find a prodn. zone slightly lower than 200 km altitude with a total prodn. rate of 4 * 10-14 g cm-2 s-1 and a C/N .simeq. 4. These results are compared with exptl. data, and to microphys. model requirements.

We use a general circulation model coupled with idealized chemical tracers that reproduce variations of ethane (C2H6), acetylene (C2H2), and hydrogen cyanide (HCN). Enhancement of the mole fractions of these compounds, at high latitudes in the winter hemisphere relative to their equatorial values, induces a relative decrease in temperature above approximately 0.2 mbar, with a peak amplitude around -20 K, and a relative increase in temperature below, around 1 mbar, with a peak amplitude around +7 K. These thermal effects are mainly due to the variations of the cooling to space induced by the varying distributions. The ethane, acetylene, and hydrogen cyanide variations affect the cooling rates in a similar way, with the dominant effect being due to ethane, though its latitudinal variations are small.},

The variation of f(z) with local vertical velocity, temp. and pressure has been calcd. under the assumption that atmospheres are convective and uncertainties have been calcd. by error propagation. Considering only the random errors, mainly the uncertainty on k-(T), the f values in the observable upper atmospheres of giant planets (i.e at z = 0, P = 1 bar) are f(0) = 1.25 +- 0.05, 1.38 +- 0.06, 1.68 +- 0.09, and 1.61 +- 0.08 for Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, resp. Addnl. systematic errors due to the uncertainty in calcg. the vertical velocity in the framework of the mixing length Prandtl theory lead to an overall uncertainty on f(0) +- 0.12, +- 0.15, +- 0.23, and +- 0.21 for each planet, resp. The D/H ratios in H2 derived from the measured CH3D/CH4 ratios in the upper atm. of the four giant planets are then recalcd. Uranus and Neptune seem to be enriched in deuterium with respect to the protosolar nebula but depleted relative to the Std. Mean Oceanic Water on the Earth (SMOW). However calcns. based on current interior models of Neptune suggest that ices which formed the core of the planet had a D/H ratio of the order of the SMOW. The deuterium abundance in proto-Uranian ices remains uncertain. The case where water is a major constituent of the fluid envelope of Neptune is discussed. It is shown that the D/H ratio of the planet would then be higher than the value measured in hydrogen. Even in this case, the D/H ratio in proto-Neptunian ices is less than the recently revised value in P/Halley and less than the value measured in water of the Semarkona meteorite. These results suggest that the ices which formed the core of Neptune did not have an interstellar origin. Similarly, the comparison of the most recent detn. of the D/H ratio in the atm. of Titan with the value of D/H in P/Halley suggests that this atm. was not formed by infalling comets but more likely from grains embedded in the sub-nebula of Saturn.

  Abstract                 = {Recent measurements of Me radicals (CH3) in the upper atmospheres of Saturn and Neptune by the IR Space Observatory (ISO) provide new constraints to photochem. models of hydrocarbon chem. in the outer solar system. The derived column abundances of CH3 on Saturn above 10 mbar and Neptune above the 0.2 mbar pressure level are (2.5 - 6.0) * 1013 cm-2 and (0.7 - 2.8) * 1013 cm-2, resp. We use the updated Caltech/Jet Propulsion Lab. photochem. model, which incorporates hydrocarbon photochem., vertical mol. and bulk atm. eddy diffusion, and realistic radiative transfer modeling, to study the CH3 abundances in the upper atm. of the giant planets and Titan. We identify the key reactions that control the concns. of CH3 in the model, such as the three-body recombination reaction, CH3 + CH3 + M -> C2H6 + M. We evaluate and extrapolate the three-body rate const. of this reaction to the low-temp. limit (1.8 * 10-16 T-3.75 e-300/T, T < 300 K) and compare Me radical abundances in five atmospheres: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Titan. The sensitivity of our models to the rate coeffs. for the reactions H + CH3 + M -> CH4 + M, H + C2H3 -> C2H2 + H2, 1CH2 + H2 -> CH3 + H, and H + C2H5 -> 2 CH3, the branching ratios of CH4 photolysis, vertical mixing in the five atmospheres, and Lyman a photon enhancement at the orbit of Neptune have all been tested. The results of our model CH3 abundances for both Saturn (5.1 * 1013 cm-2) and Neptune (2.2 * 1013 cm-2) show good agreement with ISO Short Wavelength Spectrometer measurements. Using the same chem. reaction set, our calcns. also successfully generate vertical profiles of stable hydrocarbons consistent with Voyager and ground-based measurements in these outer solar system atmospheres. Predictions of CH3 column concns. (for p ? 0.2 mbar) in the atmospheres of Jupiter (3.3 * 1013 cm-2), Uranus (2.5 * 1012 cm-2), and Titan (1.9 * 1015 cm-2) may be checked by future observations.

  Abstract                 = {The problem of Pluto's atmosphere thermal structure, as determined from the June 9, 1988 occultation data, is reassessed in the light of the detection of N2 and CO ices, along with CH4, on Pluto's surface and of recent surface temperature measurements. Firm inferences from these observations are that N2 must be the major gas of Pluto's atmosphere and that the temperature at the microbar level is about 105 K. We estimate that CH4 and CO are present at the 0.1% level of N2 in the atmosphere and we develop simple 1-D aeronomical models (solving the heat equation) for various atmospheric cases. It is found in particular that (i) if CO cooling is omitted, heating by CH4 can explain the temperature rise between the surface and the [mu]bar level, but not the drop-off observed in several occultation lightcurves below 1215 km, unless the CH4 mixing ratio is larger than 10%; (ii) if, as expected, CO is present at the [approximate]0.1% level, and CH4 is lower than 10%, then cooling by CO rotational lines is so large that CH4 heating cannot explain a 105 K temperature at 1-2 [mu]bar. A possible way to explain the temperature rise between the surface and 1 [mu]bar and the lightcurve drop-off is to invoke heating by a Titan-like haze layer with extinction optical depth [approximate](0.4-4) x 10-3 for particle sizes in the range 0.01-2 [mu]m. Such a haze can plausibly result from methane photolysis and subsequent chemistry, provided that the CH4 mixing ratio is significantly larger than 10-4. A similar haze is not expected to be present on Triton (where the methane mixing ratio is about (2-20) x 10-5), which is consistent with the fact that Triton's atmosphere near the [mu]bar level is much colder than Pluto's. Estimating production and fallout time constants suggests that haze particles in Pluto's atmosphere must be small (<=0.1 [mu]m).},

The major atmospheric constituents are assumed to be N2 and CH4 (already detected) and Ar which is a plausible additional constituent when m is greater than 28. The stratospheric abundance of CH4 is assumed to be limited by saturation at the tropopause. Spectra calculated from the infrared thermal profiles in the CH4 [nu]4 band at 7.7 [mu]m are compared with the Voyager IRIS observations. This allows us to constrain both the abundances of major atmospheric components and the stratospheric temperatures. The methane mole fraction is between 0.5 and 3.4% in the stratosphere but may be as high as 21% at the surface, whereas the atmospheric Ar/N2 ratio can be anything between 0 and 0.27. The temperature is between 92.5 and 101[degree sign]K at the ground level, and between 70.5 and 74.5[degree sign]K at the tropopause. The maximum uncertainty (+/-4[degree sign]K) occurs between 150 and 200 km altitude. A "nominal" temperature and composition profile of Titan's atmosphere between the ground and 200 km is given with tabulated values. The implications of composition and surface temperature uncertainties on the abundances of the expected major oceanic constituents are discussed, as well as the consequences for the solubility of noncodenssable atmospheric constituents (H2 and CO) and organic compounds raining out from the atmosphere.},

These observations provide a detailed characterization of the CO (1-0) vibrational band, clearly sepg. for the 1st time individual CO lines (P10 to P19 lines of 13CO). They indicate that the CO/N2 mixing ratio in Titan's troposphere is 32+-10 ppm. Comparison with photochem. models indicates that CO is not in a steady state in Titan's atm. The observations confirm that Titan's 5-mm continuum geometric albedo is .apprx.0.06, and further indicates a .apprx.20% albedo decrease over 4.98-5.07 mm. Nonzero flux is detected at the 0.01 geometric albedo level in the satd. core of the 12CO (1-0) band, at 4.75-4.85 mm, providing evidence for backscattering on the stratospheric haze. Finally, emission lines are detected at 4.75-4.835 mm, coinciding in position with lines from the CO(1-0) and/or CO(2-1) bands. Matching them by thermal emission would require Titan's stratosphere to be much warmer (by .apprx.25 K at 0.1 mbar) than indicated by the CH4 7.7-mm emission and the Voyager radio-occultation. We show instead that a nonthermal mechanism, namely solar-excited fluorescence, is a more plausible source for these emissions. Improved observations and lab. measurements on the vibrational-translational relaxation of CO are needed for further interpretation of these emissions in terms of a CO stratospheric mixing ratio.

These observations provide a detailed characterization of the CO (1-0) vibrational band, clearly separating for the first time individual CO lines (P10 to P19 lines of 13CO). They indicate that the CO/N2 mixing ratio in Titan's troposphere is 32+/-10 ppm. Comparison with photochemical models indicates that CO is not in a steady state in Titan's atmosphere. The observations confirm that Titan's 5-[mu]m continuum geometric albedo is ~0.06, and further indicates a ~20% albedo decrease over 4.98-5.07 [mu]m. Nonzero flux is detected at the 0.01 geometric albedo level in the saturated core of the 12CO (1-0) band, at 4.75-4.85 [mu]m, providing evidence for backscattering on the stratospheric haze. Finally, emission lines are detected at 4.75-4.835 [mu]m, coinciding in position with lines from the CO(1-0) and/or CO(2-1) bands. Matching them by thermal emission would require Titan's stratosphere to be much warmer (by ~ 25 K at 0.1 mbar) than indicated by the methane 7.7-[mu]m emission and the Voyager radio-occultation. We show instead that a nonthermal mechanism, namely solar-excited fluorescence, is a more plausible source for these emissions. Improved observations and laboratory measurements on the vibrational-translational relaxation of CO are needed for further interpretation of these emissions in terms of a CO stratospheric mixing ratio.},

These observations, which sample four different positions of Titan around Saturn, clearly indicate a variability of the 5-[mu]m continuum albedo, with Titan's geometric albedo decreasing by ~40% from Titan's leading side to the trailing side. This Titan 5-[mu]m "lightcurve" appears to be in phase with the other near-infrared lightcurves.

  Abstract                 = {Although methane is the dominant absorber in Titan's reflection spectrum, the amt. of methane in the atm. has only been detd. to an order of magnitude. We analyzed spectra from the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph, looking at both a bright surface region (700-km radius) and a dark surface region. The difference between the spectra of the two regions is attributed to light that has scattered off the surface, and therefore made a round-trip through all of Titan's methane. Considering only absorption, the shape of the difference spectrum provides an upper limit on methane abundance of 3.5 km-am. Modeling the multiple scattering in the atm. further constrains the methane abundance to 2.63+-0.17 km-am. In the absence of supersatn. and with a simplified methane vertical profile, this corresponds to a surface methane-mole fraction near 3.8% and a relative humidity of 0.32. With supersatn. near the tropopause, the surface methane mole fraction could be as low as 3%. [on SciFinder (R)]},

The projected field of view of IRIS (the IR spectrometer onboard) on Titan's disk is at best 60 Deg, thus allowing for only two locally independent spectral selections. The authors' atm. model is applied on spectral avs. covering the 200-1400 cm-1 range (resoln. = 4.3 cm-1). Mols. such as C2H2, C2H6, C3H4, C4H2, CH4, HCN and CO2 were clearly identified in emission with significant signal-to-noise ratios. Spectral features on the 3s level appear at frequencies where C3H8 and C2H4 have signatures. No significant temporal variations within the 9 mo were detected.

  Abstract                 = {Abstract: Titan is the largest satellite of Saturn. In its atmosphere, CH4 is the most abundant neutral after nitrogen. In this paper, the complex doublet potential-energy surface related to the reaction between HCN+ and CH4 is investigated at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p), CCSD(T)/6-311G++(3df,2pd)(single-point), and QCISD/6-311G(d,p) computational levels. A total of seven products are located on the PES. The initial association of HCN+ with CH4 is found to be a prereaction complex 1 (HCNHCH3+) without barrier. Starting from 1, the most feasible pathway is the direct H-abstraction process (the internal C-H bond dissociation) leading to the product P1 (HCNH++CH3). By C-C addition, prereaction complex 1 can form intermediate 2 (HNCHCH3+) and then lead to the product P2 (CH3CNH++H). The rate-controlling step of this process is only 25.6 kcal/mol. It makes the Path P2 (1) R 1 TS1/2 2 TS2/P2 P2 another possible way for the reaction. P3 (HCNCH3+ + H), P5 (cNCHCH2+ + H2), and P6 (NCCH3+ + H2) are exothermic products, but they have higher barriers (more than 40.0 kcal/mol); P4 (H + HCN + CH3+) and P7 (H + H2 + HCCNH+) are endothermic products. They should be discovered under different experimental or interstellar conditions. The present study may be helpful for investigating the analogous ion-molecule reaction in Titan's atmosphere.},

  Abstract                 = {We report on the discovery of emissions due to carbon monoxide from Titan's atmosphere, from mid-infrared observations with the ISAAC spectrometer at the Very Large Telescope and covering the 4.50-4.85 [mu]m range. We detected about 45 emission lines coinciding with CO ro-vibrational lines, including CO(1-0) (P18 to R11) and CO(2-1) (P11 to R11). We show that these emissions cannot be generated thermally but occur in non-LTE conditions, due to radiative de-excitation from the v=1 and v=2 CO levels after excitation at 4.7 and 2.3 [mu]m by solar radiation. A complete fluorescence model is then developed, allowing to compute the state populations of the two most abundant CO isotopes and N2(1). It includes absorption by CO and CH4, and vibrational-thermal and vibrational-vibrational collisional exchanges with CO, N2, CH4, and H2. Emerging radiances at the top of the atmosphere are evaluated with a line-by-line code and compared to observations. Contribution functions show that the CO emissions sound Titan's stratosphere: while the (1-0) lines generally probe two layers, located respectively at 100-250 km and 300-550 km, the (2-1) lines are sensitive to the intermediate layer at 150-300 km. A sensitivity study is performed to establish the effect of the main model parameters (temperature profile, collisional scenario, and CO stratospheric abundance) on the results. Models reproduce the essential structure of the observed emissions. The (1-0) fundamental band is generally well fit with a nominal CO mixing ratio of 32 ppm--as inferred in the troposphere from observations at 4.80-5.10 [mu]m (Lellouch et al., 2003, Icarus 162, 126-143). However, this band is only weakly dependent on the CO abundance, and given temperature and collisional scenario uncertainties, it constrains the CO stratospheric mixing ratio only to within a factor of ~3. In addition, the nominal model with 32 ppm CO underestimates the first hot (2-1) transition by approximately a factor of 2. This discrepancy can be resolved by a combined adjustment of collisional rates and an increased CO stratospheric ratio of 60 ppm, consistent with the determination of Gurwell and Muhleman (2000, Icarus 145, 653-656). In contrast, the CO vertical profile suggested by Hidayat et al. (1998, Icarus 133, 109-133), strongly depleted above 200 km, cannot match the data for any realistic collisional scenario, and is therefore not supported by our results.},

Variation of b.p. with depth of ethane-methane-nitrogen fluids is found to be of order 0.3 K m-1, in contrast with around 2 K m-1 for water on Earth. It is found that geysers are possible on Titan but require enhancements of .apprx.100 above global-av. geothermal heat flux, a factor similar to that required on Earth. Eruption velocities of order 25 m s-1 appear to be typical for 10-m-deep geyser vents on both Earth and Titan. While eruption velocities on Earth are usually limited by the low sound speed in water-steam mixts., sound speeds in Titan fluids are higher and the Titan limit is imposed by the available energy in the boiling fluid. Eruption intervals should be nearly the same for geysers with equiv. plumbing. There is an interesting symmetry between geysers on Titan and those on Earth: the volatility of the relevant fluid scales with the available heat flow. [on SciFinder (R)]},

The model, using conventional aerodynamics, with raindrop distortion parameterized by the Weber no., gives excellent agreement with terrestrial raindrop data. Terminal descent velocities for drops of various sizes at different altitudes are presented, and it is found that the largest raindrops may be larger than those on Earth (9.5 mm diam. vs 6.5 mm diam.) yet fall much more slowly (1.6 m s-1 vs 9.2 m s-1). Under std. conditions on Titan, raindrops evap. before they reach the ground : profiles showing the shrinking of drops due to evapn. during their descent are shown for various values of relative humidity. A 500 m increase in elevation can lead to a tenfold increase in rain mass flux, leading to increased \"washing\" of highland terrain. It is pointed out that evapg. raindrops will leave behind their condensation nuclei: fall times for these are presented, and it is noted that they may significantly affect visibility in the troposphere. The effects of addnl. factors on raindrop behavior, such as the nonideal soly. of nitrogen in methane, are briefly considered. [on SciFinder (R)]},

It accordingly plays an important role in formation models of Titan, Saturn's largest moon. Current understanding assumes that methane hydrate dissocs. into ice and free methane in the pressure range 1-2 GPa (10-20kbar), consistent with some theor. and exptl. studies. But such pressure-induced dissocn. would have led to the early loss of methane from Titan's interior to its atm., where it would rapidly have been destroyed by photochem. processes. This is difficult to reconcile with the obsd. presence of significant amts. of methane in Titan's present atm. Here we report neutron and synchrotron X-ray diffraction studies that det. the thermodn. behavior of methane hydrate at pressures up to 10GPa. We find structural transitions at about 1 and 2 GPa to new hydrate phases which remain stable to at least 10 GPa. This implies that the methane in the primordial core of Titan remained in stable hydrate phases throughout differentiation, eventually forming a layer of methane clathrate approx. 100 km thick within the ice mantle. This layer is a plausible source for the continuing replenishment of Titan's atm. methane. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  Abstract                 = {This paper discusses current understanding of the nature of Titan's surface and presents some new ideas for explaining the curious radar returns from Saturn's largest satellite. Pre-Voyager models of the surface based largely on cosmochem. and the discovery of atm. CH4 allowed for a range of possibilities, including pure CH4 oceans. The Voyage 1 flyby ruled out this last possibility, replacing it with compelling observational arguments in favor of a mixed light-hydrocarbon and N ocean. Ground-based radar observations indicated a surprisingly reflective surface, inconsistent with a hydrocarbon ocean and more reminiscent of the Galilean satellites. Nonetheless, passive radiometric measurements of the surface do not support the notion that Titan's surface is like that of the Galilean satellites. One of the arguments against hydrocarbon oceans reflecting radar energy is that most solid, complex hydrocarbons and nitriles will be denser than the liq. and sink. Nonetheless, many of the aerosol species will coagulate in highly non-spherical patterns, and some species probably polymerize in long chains. Such chains will have very low sedimentation velocities in the ocean, and may remain near the surface through ocean mixing process. The prospect of an oceanic \"soup\" of polar polymers acting as vol. reflectors at radio wavelengths suggests that the interpretation of radar observations needs reevaluation. [on SciFinder (R)]},

Titan thus affords a remarkable opportunity to understand the evolution of an org.-rich, planet- sized world with chem. cycles powered over geol. time by sunlight.

Probe images in the optical and near-IR right up to the point of impact will be complemented by Orbiter imagery in the near-IR and through active radar sounding.

  Abstract                 = {A review, with 54 refs., is given. The solar system's 2nd largest natural satellite is shrouded by a thick nitrogen atm., rich in methane, within which sunlight- and cosmic-ray-driven org. chem. has gone on for some 4.5 billion years. The earliest history of Titan's atm., and specifically its origin, remains unclear until the Cassini-Huygens probe measures the ratio of argon to nitrogen and the abundances of other noble gases and isotopes. However, the abundance of deuterated methane in the atm. today is consistent with an atm. that originated in the chem.-processed sub-nebula around Saturn, rather than in cometary material. Titan's overall atm. history is driven by the depletion of methane, and the mechanisms by which methane might be resupplied from surface on external sources. Remote sensing data mitigate against a large reservoir of methane at Titan's surface, leaving open the possibility that methane is periodically depleted from Titan's atm. on timescales of 107-108 years; under such conditions Titan might oscillate between thin and thick atm. epochs. Titan's surface may provide a repository for complex org. mols. that were synthesized during times when liq. water was temporarily available on the surface, such as after impacts or cryo-volcanic eruptions. Such mols. might provide clues to the resoln. of some difficult issues assocd. with the origin of life. Identifying the presence and nature of such mols. is a difficult exploration problem that must be left to missions which follow-on from the Cassini-Huygens exploration of Titan. [on SciFinder (R)]},

H. van der Waals and J. C. Platteeuw (1959) and existing exptl. data on properties of clathrate hydrates and their components. At low pressure, dissocn. pressures and partition functions (Langmuir consts.) for CO clathrate (hydrate) were predicted, using the properties of clathrate contg. (as guests) mols. similar to CO. The comparable or higher propensity of CO to incorporate in clathrate relative to N2 is used to argue for high CO-to-N2 ratios in primordial Titan if N2 was accreted as clathrate. The relative incorporation of noble gases in clathrate from a solar compn. gas at low temps. is calcd. and applied to the case of giant-planet atmospheres and icy satellites. Nonsolar but well-constrained noble gas abundances will be measured by Galileo in the Jovian atm. if the obsd. C enhancement is due to the bombardment of the atm. by clathrate-bearing planetesimals sometime after planetary formation. The noble-gas abundances in Titan's atm. are also predicted under the hypothesis that much of the satellite's CH4 accreted as clathrate. Double occupancy of clathrate cages by H2 and CH4 in contact with a solar-compn. gas is examd., and it is concluded that potentially important amts. of H2 may have been incorporated in satellites as clathrate. The kinetics of clathrate formation is also examd., and it is suggested that, under thermodn. appropriate conditions essentially complete clathration of water ice could have occurred in high-pressure nebulae around giant planets by probably not in the outer solar nebula; comets probably did not aggregate as clathrate. At moderate pressures, the phase diagram for CH4 clathrate hydrate in the presence of 15% NH3 (relative to water) is constructed, and application to the early Titan amt. compn. is described. The high-pressure stability of CH4, N2, and mixed CH4-N2 clathrate hydrate is calcd.; conversion back to water and CH4 and/or N2 fluids or solids is predicted for pressures .gtorsim. 12 kilobars (independent of temp.) and temps. .gtorsim. 320 K (independent of pressure. The effect of NH3 is to shrink the T-P stability field of clathrate with increasing NH3 concn. These results imply that (1) clathrate is stable throughout the interior of Oberon- and Rhea-sized icy satellites, and (2) clathrate incorporated in the innersmost icy regions of Tian would have decompd., perhaps allowing buoyant CH4 to rise.

The surprisingly high soly. of water ice in liq. CH4 (R. Rebiai et al., 1983) implies that topog. features on Titan of order 100 m in height can be eroded away on a time scale .ltorsim.109 yr. The large soly. difference of N2 in CH4 vs. C2H6 implies that the ocean compn. is a strong determinant of atm. pressure; a simple radiative model of the Titan atm. is employed to demonstrate that significant surface pressure and temp. changes can occur as the oceanic compn. evolves with time.

  Abstract                 = {Recently published nitrogen and hydrogen isotopic data were analyzed to constrain the initial volatile abundances on Saturn's giant moon Titan. The nitrogen data are interpreted in terms of a model of non-thermal escape processes that lead to enhancement in the heavier isotope. The authors show that these data do not, in fact, strongly constrain the abundance of nitrogen present in Titan's early atm., and that a wide range of initial atm. masses (all larger than the present value) can yield the measured enhancement. The enrichment in deuterated methane is now much better detd. than it was when Pinto et al. (1986) first proposed a photochem. mechanism to preferentially retain the deuterium. A simple linear theory is developed to provide a more reliable est. of the relative dissocn. rates of normal and deuterated methane. The improved data and models are used to compute initial methane reservoirs consistent with the obsd. enhancement. The result of this anal. agrees with an independent est. for the initial methane abundance based solely on the present-day rate of photolysis and an assumption of steady state. This consistency in reservoir size is necessary but not sufficient to infer that methane photolysis has proceeded steadily over the age of the solar system to produce large quantities of less volatile orgs. The anal. indicates an epoch of early atm. escape of nitrogen, followed by a later addn. of methane by outgassing from the interior. The results also suggest that Titan's volatile inventory came in part or largely from a circum-Saturnian disk of material more reducing than the surrounding solar nebula. Many of the ambiguities inherent in the present anal. can be resolved through Cassini-Huygens data and a program of lab. studies on isotopic and mol. exchange processes. The value of, and interest in, the Cassini-Huygens data can be greatly enhanced if such a program were undertaken prior to the prime phase of the mission. [on SciFinder (R)]},

We develop a parameterization of latitudinal eddy mixing by barotropic waves based on a shallow-water, longitude-latitude model. The parameterization acts locally and in real time both on passive tracers and momentum. The mixing coefficient varies exponentially with a measure of the barotropic instability of the mean zonal flow. The coupled GCM approximately reproduces the Voyager temperature measurements and the latitudinal contrasts in the distributions of HCN and C2H2, as well as the main features of the zonal wind retrieved from the 1989 stellar occultation. Wind velocities are consistent with the observed reversal time of the North-South albedo asymmetry of 5 terrestrial years. Model results support the hypothesis of a non-uniform distribution of infrared opacity as the cause of the Voyager temperature asymmetry. Transport by the mean meridional circulation, combined with polar vortex isolation may be at the origin of the latitudinal contrasts of trace species, with eddy mixing remaining restricted to low latitudes most of the Titan year. We interpret the contrasts as a signature of non-axisymmetric motions.},

  Abstract                 = {A theor. study was made on the interaction of energetic H, He, C, and Fe ions from solar wind and cosmic rays with the atm. of Titan, a satellite of planet Saturn. It was based on computer simulation of binary collisions with the program MARLOWE in a kind of Monte Carlo calcn. Two main issues were discussed. Firstly, the prodn. of energetic secondary atoms with energies exceeding 0.5 eV by knock on processes and the range of the primary ions in a model lattice contg. the atm. components nitrogen, argon, and methane in 3 mixts. was modeled. Secondly, the model calcn. was applied to Titan's atm. using the range of primaries and the barometric formula in a 10 km bin arrangement. A distribution profile of secondary N, C, and H atoms resulted, depending on the kind and energy of primary ions. The MARLOWE program had to be modified for the application to a gas phase and high energy collisions. The latter was achieved by introducing the Bethe-Bloch formalism and relativistic corrections to inelastic loss calcn. Results show that heavy primary particles (C, Fe) produce very high nos. of secondaries. This counterbalances their low abundance in space radiation in view of chem. effects. An interesting result was that light primaries with 108 eV and heavy ones even up to 1010 eV dissipate their energy mainly within Titan's atm. and do not reach the solid surface. For a 98% N2 and 2% CH4 mixt. the column d. of all hot atoms generated by space particle radiation from H to Fe was calcd. to about 2*109 cm-2s-1. An important contribution of these hot atoms can be expected locally in the actual atm. On a global scale in the change from a primordial to the existing atm. during the lifetime of the solar system, the no. d. of these suprathermal atoms amounted to ~ 2*1026 cm-2, i.e. the total column d. of the atm., which implies that each atom once had been a suprathermal atom. The study was complemented by an exptl. approach. Hot chem. reactions of secondary atoms were studied by 32 MeV 3He2+ ions from Juelich compact cyclotron impinging onto a gas target with pure methane and mixts. of N2 and CH4 at 1.6 bar. The nuclear reaction 12C(3He,4He)11C created radioactive 11C recoils which labeled typical hot products. These could be analyzed by radiogaschromatog. Results show that the formation of carbon-nitrogen compds. is not favored, a result which is reflected in the atm. compn. of Titan. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  Abstract                 = {A mixt. of six DL-amino acids in prebiotic proportions were immersed in heavy mineral oil, warmed up to 240 Deg and exposed to the action of spark discharges on a mixt. of H2O and CO2 gases. Water sol. products were analyzed by Fourier transformed IR spectroscopy (FTIR) showing yields of peptide-like compds. characterized by amidine linkages and other mols. consisting of arom. and non-arom. alcs. and nitrogenous aroms. Non-sol. products analyzed by SEM revealed the presence of a material comparable to tholins whereas the products sol. in water showed the presence of an amphiphilic component. The recovered amts. and the FTIR spectra corresponding to heavy mineral oil exposed to simulated exptl. conditions including UVC-radiations, clearly show no difference relative to initial sample indicating that the decompn. rate of these mols. should be very slow at the time. Therefore, we consider plausible that alkane environments >=n-C18 occurring on the early terrestrial planets could offer several advantages for the synthesis and survival of nitrogenous mols., particularly towards the end or after the age of the large impacts, such as protection against oxidizing atmospheres, high temps. generated by greenhouse effects or shock waves and protection against decompn. effects caused by high UVC-radiations, corona discharges and lightning. Currently, these facts could be happening in other regions of our solar system and in extrasolar planets allowing the formation and accumulation of complex nitrogenous mols. [on SciFinder (R)]},

Lewis (1973), the probability of growth of a contaminant terrestrial microorganisms is nil. If, as is likely, conditions are even more extreme on Neptune, the probability of contamination of both of the outer planets Uranus and Neptune is nil. The probability of growth was estd. with respect to the following factors: the presence of stable liq. water, water layer, org. mol. prodn. by solar UV light, NH3 concn. at the water cloud level, ionic species distribution, and concns. at the water cloud level. The evaluation of these factors suggests that most terrestrial life as we known it would be excluded on the basis of any one of them. No known organism would be adapted to all the stringent Uranus conditions simultaneously.

Quoted uncertainties include statistical (95% confidence) and systematic (15%) errors. Interpreting the temp. dependence is difficult, as there is a possibility that the reaction behaves in a non-Arrhenius manner.

HCN (b.p. 25 Deg) polymerizes readily to a black solid from which a yellow-brown powder can be extd. by water and further hydrolyzed to yield a-amino acids. These macromols. could be major components of the dark matter obsd. on many bodies in the outer solar system. The non-volatile black crust of comet Halley, for example, may consist largely of such polymers, since the original presence on cometary nuclei of frozen volatiles such as methane, ammonia, and water makes them possible sites for the formation and condensed-phase polymn. of hydrogen cyanide. It seems likely, too, that HCN polymers are among the dark -C.tplbond.N bearing solids identified spectroscopically by Cruikshank et al. in the dust of some other comets, on the surfaces of several asteroids of spectral class D, within the rings of Uranus, and covering the dark hemisphere of Saturn's satellite Iapetus. HCN polymn. could account also for the yellow-orange-brown coloration of Jupiter and Saturn, as well as for the orange haze high in Titan's atm. Implications for prebiotic chem. are profound. Primitive Earth may have been covered by HCN polymers through cometary bombardment or terrestrial synthesis, producing a proteinaceous matrix that promoted the the mol. interactions leading to the emergence of life.

  Abstract                 = {Spectrophotometric observations at uv, visible, and near-ir wavelengths of 5 of Saturn's satellites, Tethys, Dione, Rhea, Titan, and Iapetus, and the equatorial band of Saturn were made during the 1968 and 1969 apparitions. Spectral resoln., achieved by using a series of narrow-band interference filters, ranged from 0.02 m in the uv to 0.05 m in the ir. The 60-in. (152 cm) and 100-in. (254 cm) telescopes on Mount Wilson were used. All satellites except Titan show evidence of synchronous rotation. Tethys, Dione, and Rhea all show some variation in brightness with orbital phase, their leading sides being 10-20% brighter than their trailing sides. No change in Titan's brightness with phase was obsd. The large change in Iapetus's brightness with orbital phase was confirmed. Iapetus shows significant variation in its spectrum with orbital phase, with its darker side \"redder\" than the brighter side by at least 15% between 0.4 and 0.8 m. All of the satellites except Titan have similar reflection spectra, relatively const. from 0.4 to 0.8 m and then decreasing from 0.8 to 1.1 m. Dione shows the largest decrease in the ir with a decrease of .apprx.15% from 0.8 to 1.0 m. The reflection spectra of these 4 satellites are consistent with what is known of H2O and NH3 frost spectra in the spectral range 0.4-1.1 m. The satellite spectra are not similar to spectra for most ferrosilicates; nor are they similar to spectra of the Moon, Mars, or the Galilean satellites. More surprisingly, the satellite spectra in this spectral region are quite different from the spectrum of Saturn's rings, where water ice has been identified in ir spectra. This difference implies the presence of some materials in the rings which are absent on the satellite surfaces. Titan's spectrum is also different from the spectra of the other satellites, but it is similar to the spectrum of Saturn's equatorial belt. This suggests that material present in the optical surface of Saturn's belt is similar to materials on Titan, perhaps on Titan's surface. CH4 absorptions affect both the belt spectrum and Titan's spectrum beyond 0.6 m. The Saturn and Titan spectra differ in the uv. Rayleigh scattering in gases above an uv haze layer (about 10 km-atm H2) can account for the uv turnup in Saturn's spectrum. There is much less Rayleigh scattering on Titan, which suggests a thin (10-1000 m-atm) atm., through which the surface may be visible. [on SciFinder (R)]},

Microsoft issued a patch that allegedly fixed the problem so that the patched Excel 2003 and Excel 2007 now implement the Wichmann-Hill RNG, as least according to Microsoft. We show that whatever RNG it is that Microsoft has implemented in these versions of Excel, it is not the Wichmann-Hill RNG.

From high-pressure liq. chromatog., UV and IR spectroscopy, and mol. wt. estn. by gel filtration chromatog., the authors conclude that (1) several H2O-sol. fractions, each with distinct UV and IR spectral signatures, are present, (2) these fractions are not identical in the two tholins, (3) the H2O-sol. fractions of Titan tholins do not contain significant amts. of nitriles, despite the major role of nitriles in bulk Titan tholin, and (4) the H2O-sol. fractions of both tholins are mainly mols. contg. about 10 to 50 (C + N) atoms.

  Abstract                 = {Atoms which escape Titan's atmosphere are unlikely to possess escape velocity from Saturn, and can orbit the planet until lost by ionization or collision with Titan. It is predicted that a toroidal ring of between ~1 and ~103 atoms or molecules cm-3 exists around Saturn at a distance of about 10 times the radius of the visible rings. This torus may be detectable from Earth-orbit and detection of nondetection of it may provide some information about the presence or absence of a Saturnian magnetic field, and the exospheric temperature and atmospheric escape rate of Titan. It is estimated that, if Titan has a large exosphere, ~97% or more of the escaping atoms can be recaptured by Titan, thereby decreasing the effective net atmospheric loss rate by up to two orders of magnitude. With such a reduction in atmospheric loss rates, it becomes more plausible to suggest that satellites previously thought too small to retain an atmosphere may have one. It is suggested that Saturn be examined by Lyman-[alpha] and other observations to search for the gaseous torus of Titan. If successful, these could then be extended to other satellites. The effect of a hypothetical Saturnian magnetosphere on the atmosphere of Titan is investigated. It is shown that, if Saturn has a magnetic field comparable to Jupiter's (~10 G at the planetary surface), the magnetospheric plasma can supply Titan with hydrogen at a rate comparable to the loss rates in some of the models of [Trafton, 1972] and [Sagan, 1973]. A major part of the Saturnian ionospheric escape flux (~ 1027 photoelectrons sec-1) could perhaps be captured by Titan. At the upper limit, this rate of hydrogen input to the satellite could total ~0.1 atm pressure over the lifetime of the solar system, an amount comparable to estimates of the present atmospheric pressure of Titan.},

The ions selected for this study were derived either from nitrogen, appropriate hydrocarbons or nitrites. The reactant neutrals were selected on the basis of their known presence in Titan's atmosphere. The reaction products are consistent with the expected increase in ion size through ion molecule reaction processing. Data are also presented for the reactions of 23 ions with molecular nitrogen. Almost all of these ions are unreactive with N2.},

  Abstract                 = {Ultraviolet spectra of Titan obtained with the Faint Object Spectrograph of the Hubble Space Telescope in October 1991 and August 1992 have yielded a disk-average geometric albedo of 0.02-0.044 from 1800-3300 A. These results are in excellent agreement with previous UV measurements from 2200-3300 A spanning two decades, but have a significantly higher signal to noise ratio and spectral resolution. We add ~400 A of new spectral information from 1800-2200 A, a wavelength region in which Titan has not been detected previously. The albedo above 2200 A is a factor of 1.18 higher in August 1992 than October 1991, which is most likely due to the 4.3[degree sign] difference in Titan's phase angle between the two dates. Below 2200 A the albedo decreases only modestly with decreasing wavelength and does not show unambiguous evidence for discrete spectral features characteristic of several of the known hydrocarbons, particularly acetylene (C2H2). Comparison of the albedo with best-fit models provides constraints on the optical properties and distribution of the small particle component of Titan's haze and on the C2H2mole fraction. The small particle haze seems to be darker in the UV than the "Titan" tholins analog produced in the laboratory, and the vertical extent limited to altitudes above ~120-150 km. The acetylene distribution is consistent with the Voyager IRIS determination in the 130- to 180-km altitude range, where the mole fraction is of order 2 x 10-6.},

  Abstract                 = {Titan's haze is optically thick in the visible, with an optical depth at 0.5 mm of about three. The haze varies with latitude in a seasonal cycle and has a detached upper layer. Microphys. models, photochem. models, and lab. simulations all imply that the prodn. rate of the haze is in the range of (0.5-2) * 10-14g cm-2s-1. Given the rate of sedimentation, the total mass loading is about 250 mg m-2. The transparency of the haze is high for wavelengths above 1 mm because the haze material becomes almost purely scattering and the optical depth decreases with increasing wavelength. The particles in the main haze deck are probably fractal in structure with an equiv. vol. radius of 0.2 mm. The haze material is org. and, if similar to lab. tholin, has a C/N ratio in the range of 2-4 and a C/H ratio of about unity. The haze significantly affects the thermal balance of Titan, causing an antigreenhouse effect that cools the surface by 9 K. Titan's faintly banded appearance suggests strong zonal winds in the lower stratosphere. Condensate clouds of ethane or methane, if present, are thin, patchy, or transient. Stratospheric clouds of condensed nitriles and (possibly) hydrocarbons appear to be assocd. with, though not contained entirely in, the polar shadow, suggesting abundances may vary with the season. Pptg. condensate particles from the stratosphere probably act as nucleating centers for the formation and rapid growth of methane ice particles in the troposphere, where the gas phase appears to be highly supersatd. Once formed, fallout times for these hailstones are .apprx.2 h or less. Melting, and possible subsequent fragmentation of methane raindrops, should occur at .apprx.12 km and below. Almost complete evapn. should occur just above the surface. A thin residue of ethane-enriched fog particles would then slowly settle to the surface, steadily modifying an existing surface or subsurface residue of liq. hydrocarbons. The optical properties of the haze in the 1 to 3 mm spectral region and the implications for the visibility of the surface are probably the most pressing current research questions. Other key questions include the nature of the high altitude detached haze layer, altitude and seasonal changes in compn. of the haze, the role of haze particles as condensation nuclei for clouds, and the nature of any condensate clouds.

An antigreenhouse is obsd. on Titan and has been proposed for the early Earth. Here, we derive an analytic soln. useful for computing the atm. and surface temp. with both the greenhouse and antigreenhouse effects included. In agreement with detailed calcns., the analytic soln. predicts that a runaway greenhouse on early Titan caused by accretional heat would collapse when the flux fell to 0.9 W m-2. For the present value of the solar luminosity a runaway greenhouse collapses at a geothermal heat flux of 0.4 W m-2. We show that the antigreenhouse effect may compromise attempts to solve the faint young sun problem on the early Earth with a methane-ammonia greenhouse shielded by an org. haze, more than doubling the IR opacity needed to warm the early Earth compared to the case with no antigreenhouse.

  Abstract                 = {We have reanalyzed the Voyager radio occultation data for Titan, examg. two alternative approaches to methane condensation. In one approach, methane condensation is facilitated by the presence of nitrogen because nitrogen lowers the condensation level of a methane/nitrogen mixt. The resulting enhancement in methane condensation lowers the upper limit on surface relative humidity of methane obtained from the Voyager occultation data from 0.7 to 0.6. In this case the surface relative humidity of methane lies between 0.08 and 0.6, with values close to 0.6 indicated. In the other approach, methane is allowed to become supersatd. and reaches 1.4 times satn. in the troposphere. In this case, surface humidities up to 100% are allowed by the Voyager occultation data, and thus the upper limit must be set by other considerations. If supersatn. is included, then the surface relative humidity of methane can be any value greater than 0.08-unless a deep ocean is present, in which case the surface relative humidity is limited to less than 0.85. Again, values close to 0.6 are indicated. Overall, the tropospheric lapse rate on Titan appears to be detd. by radiative equil. The lapse rate is everywhere stable against dry convection, but is unstable to moist convection. This finding is consistent with a supersatd. atm. in which condensation-and hence moist convection-is inhibited. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  Abstract                 = {A radiative-convective model is developed of the thermal structure of Titan's atm. The model computes the solar and IR radiation in a series of spectral intervals with vertical resoln. Sources of opacity in the visible and near-IR include stratospheric haze particles, CH4 cloud particles, and gaseous CH4; IR sources of opacity in the thermal IR include the pressure-induced opacity of N2, CH4, and H2, the permitted transitions of C2H2 and C2H6, and particulate opacity. The haze properties were detd. with a simple microphysics model. The model contains a min. of free parameters; an attempt was made to det. these by fits to independent data sets. Gas and haze opacity alone, with the temps. fixed by Voyager observations, produces a model that is within a few percent of radiative convective balance everywhere in the atm. In a self-consistent computation of temps., model calcn. for the surface temp. is, in general, colder than the obsd. value by 5-10 DegK. The presence or absence of CH4 condensation clouds only slightly alters the results. Good agreement can be obtained by adjusting the parameters in the model. The model parameters in these optimized cases are typically within 15% of the baseline values and within the limits allowed by observations. The most important factors controlling Titan's thermal structure are absorption of sunlight by the stratospheric haze and the pressure-induced gas opacity in the IR. Within the uncertainties of the model, these effects can explain the obsd. temp. profile. Condensation clouds play a minor role, if any. [on SciFinder (R)]},

The e for O2+, CH5+, C2H5+, and C6H7+ have been determined at temperatures ranging from 80 to 600 K. Data for O2+ over the temperature range of 100-500 K establish a single-power law dependence, which is consistent with previous data in this temperature range. The hydrocarbon data show that the e are large at room temperature, being 1.1 × 10-6, 1.2 × 10-6, and 2.4 × 10-6 cm3 s-1 for CH5+, C2H5+, and C6H7+, respectively, and exhibit significant dependencies on temperature consistent with theoretical models based on the direct and indirect mechanisms. The change between these two dependencies occurs at a temperature of ~300 K. The dissociative recombination of these ions is significant to molecular synthesis in interstellar clouds and the ionosphere of Titan, which is to be probed by the NASA Huygens-Cassini spacecraft that reaches the Saturnian system in July 2004.

This was tested using the H3+ + allene reaction in which two different C3H3+ isomers are produced. Use of an electrostatic Langmuir probe enabled the C3H3+ isomer branching ratios for propargyl and cyclic C3H3+ from this allene reaction and their e to be determined over the temperature range 172-489 K. The study showed that the cyclic C3H3+ to propargyl C3H3+ branching ratios from the allene reaction varied from 50/50 at 172 K to 18/82 at 489 K. Over this temperature range, the e for both isomers change only slightly. The room temperature e values for propargyl and cyclic C3H3+ are (1.15 ± 0.2) × 10-7 and (8.00 ± 0.1) × 10-7 cm3/s, respectively.

  Abstract                 = {The reaction of carbon atoms in their 3Pj electronic ground state with hydrogen cyanide, HCN (X 1S+), is explored computationally to investigate the formation of hitherto undetected C2N isomers in the interstellar medium via a neutral-neutral reaction. Our ab initio calculations expose that the reaction has no entrance barrier and proceeds on the triplet surface via addition of the carbon atom to the p-bond, yielding a cyclic HC2N intermediate. This complex either decomposes to cyclic C2N plus atomic hydrogen or rearranges via ring opening to the HCNC or HCCN isomers. These molecules can fragment via atomic hydrogen ejection to the linear CCN (2P) and CNC (2Pg) radicals. The formation of all three C2N isomers proceeds without any exit barrier, but the reactions to form CNC, CCN, and c-C2N are found to be strongly endothermic by 52.7, 59.0, and 99.6 kJ mol-1, respectively. Based on these investigations, the neutral-neutral reaction of atomic carbon with hydrogen cyanide cannot synthesize C2N isomers in cold molecular clouds, where average translation temperatures of the reactants are only 10-15 K. However, the physical conditions in circumstellar envelopes of, for example, IRC+10216, differ strongly; close to the photosphere of the central star, temperatures can reach 4000 K, and the elevated velocity of both reactants in the long tail of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution can overcome the reaction endothermicity to form at least the linear CNC and CCN isomers. Therefore, these environments represent ideal targets to search for hitherto undetected CNC (2P) and CNC (2Pg) via either infrared or microwave spectroscopy.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last few decades, mass spectrometry has become a powerful tool for exploring various aspects of molecular processes occurring in biological systems. Such exploration is leading to a greater understanding of various complex life processes; unraveling these processes poses the greatest challenge to contemporary bioscience. With due respect to sample preparation, data analysis is rapidly becoming a major obstacle to the conversion of experimental knowledge into valid conclusions. It is interesting to note that many problems related to mass spectrometry can be solved using techniques from computer science, graph theory and discrete mathematics. The aim of this manuscript is to recollect several essays that demonstrate the power and the need to apply such skills to mass spectrometry data interpretation. Special attention is paid to situations where traditional chemical analysis reaches its limits but mathematical reasoning can still allow us to reach valid conclusions.},

At NCH4 greater than 10(17) cm-3 condensation constitutes 5--20% of the overall reactions. The product of the condensation reaction further associates with CO2 to form C2H5NH3+ . CO2; the atomic composition of this cluster ion is identical with the protonated amino acid alanine. The carbonium ions i-C3H7+ and t-C4H9+ condense also with HCN to yield protonated isocyanides. HCNH% also appears to condense with HCN at T greater than 570 degrees K, and form cluster ions with HCN at lower temperatures. The rate constants of the condensation reactions vary with temperature and pressure in a complex manner. Under conditions similar to those on Titan at an altitude of 100 km (T = 100--150 degrees K, NCH4 approximately 10(18) cm-3), with a methane atmosphere containing 1% H2 and traces of NH3 and H2O, ion-molecule condensation reactions followed by H+ transfer are expected to lead to the atmospheric synthesis of C2H6, C3H8, CH3OH, C2H5OH and the terminal ions NH4+, CH3NH3+ and C2H5NH3+. At higher temperatures (250 degrees K smaller than T smaller than 400 degrees K), the synthesis of i-C4H10, i-C3H7OH and t-C4H9OH and of the ions i-C3H7NH3+ and t-C4H9NH3+ is also expected. Electron recombination of the terminal ions may yield amines, imines and nitriles. Cycles of protonation and dissociative recombination of the alkanes and alcohols produced in condensation reactions will also produce unsaturated hydrocarbons, ketones and aldehydes in the ionized atmosphere.

  Abstract                 = {Abstract: Scale factors for obtaining fundamental vibrational frequencies, low-frequency vibrational frequencies, zero-point vibrational energies (ZPVEs), and thermal contributions to enthalpy and entropy have been derived through a least-squares approach from harmonic frequencies determined at more than 100 levels of theory. Wave function procedures (HF, MP2, QCISD, QCISD(T), CCSD, and CCSD(T)) and a large and representative range of density functional theory (DFT) approaches (B3-LYP, BMK, EDF2, M05-2X, MPWB1K, O3-LYP, PBE, TPSS, etc.) have been examined in conjunction with basis sets such as 6-31G(d), 6-31+G(d,p), 6-31G(2df,p), 6-311+G(d,p), and 6-311+G(2df,p). The vibrational frequency scale factors were determined by a comparison of theoretical harmonic frequencies with the corresponding experimental fundamentals utilizing a standard set of 1066 individual vibrations. ZPVE scale factors were generally obtained from a comparison of the computed ZPVEs with experimental ZPVEs for a smaller standard set of 39 molecules, though the effect of expansion to a 48 molecule data set was also examined. In addition to evaluating the scale factors for a wide range of levels of theory, we have also probed the effect on scale factors of varying the percentage of incorporated exact exchange in hybrid DFT calculations using a modified B3-LYP functional. This has revealed a near-linear relationship between the magnitude of the scale factor and the proportion of exact exchange. Finally, we have investigated the effect of basis set size on HF, MP2, B3-LYP, and BMK scale factors by deriving values with basis sets ranging from 6-31G(d) up to 6-311++G(3df,3pd) as well as with basis sets in the cc-pVnZ and aug-cc-pVnZ series and with the TZV2P basis.},

The authors have developed a cluster representation of 3*3 elementary cells which proved to be a model system for the adsorption at a 2-dimensional (100) SrO terminated surface. Model calcns. for TiO2 and CH4 adsorption at this and a variety of modified clusters allowed an estn. of the errors introduced using a finite cluster instead of the infinite surface. Calcns. show that the TTIP precursor has a much higher energy of adsorption, a closer distance of the adsorbed state to the surface as well as a higher dissocn. energy than the TiO(thd)2 mol. From these results it is rather straightforward to expect a higher sticking probability and a lower surface mobility for TTIP than for TiO(thd)2. This is in good agreement with exptl. results on edge coverage of BST films deposited by the MOCVD method from the resp. Ti precursors. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  Abstract                 = {This paper is concerned with the chemical evolution of large molecules in interstellar clouds. We consider the chemistry and ionisation balance of large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) type molecules in diffuse clouds and show that certain PAH molecules can be doubly ionised by the interstellar ultraviolet radiation field. If recombination of the dications so produced with electrons is dissociative rather than radiative, then PAHs are rapidly destroyed. PAHs which can only be singly ionised have much smaller recombination energies and can be long lasting in these regions. This type of property may be very important in selecting the PAH species which can populate the general interstellar medium and account for certain of the diffuse bands observed in optical spectra. Destruction of PAH molecules via formation of dications may be responsible for the weakening of the diffuse bands observed in regions of high UV flux. We also discuss the chemistry of large, saturated molecules in hot molecular cores in star-forming regions. Here it appears that gas phase abundances are determined by surface chemistry on the cold ice mantles of interstellar grains. We present the preliminary results of a study of deuterium chemistry in these hot cores with the aim of probing both the detailed surface processes by which complex molecules are synthesised and the gas phase reactions which destroy them.},

  Abstract                 = {There are numerous examples of complex macromol. solids found in carbonaceous chondrites and IDPs or formed in simulation expts. (tholins) and the polymn. of hydrogen cyanide. These macromol. solids provide extremely challenging anal. problems. Both non-degradative methods (solid state NMR, MALDI, SIMS, XANES, etc) and degradative methods (pyrolysis/MS, pyrolysis/GC-MS, hydrolysis/LC-MS or TMAH thermochemolysis/GC-MS have been applied to some or all of these solids and provide some insight into their substructural units. As an example of the latter method, by heating HCN polymer or a tholin produced from a CH4/N2 glow discharge Titan simulation expt. with tetramethylammonium hydroxide at 250-300 DegC, concommitant bond cleavage and in situ methylation takes place yielding a large no. of products that can be sepd. and analyzed by GC-MS (Minard et. al. , 1998). Many products from both HCN polymer and the tholin were the same and imply substructural units of many types: diacyl, amino acyl, purine/pyrimidine, or triazine that are relevant to biochem. The application of this and other anal. methods to the unraveling of the structure of macromol. materials relevant to the origin of life will be presented.

  Abstract                 = {Dissociative electron-ion recombination (DR) is an important ionization loss process and source of neutral reactive radicals in the interstellar medium (ISM) and many other molecular plasmas. Unfortunately, neutral products are difficult to identify with only about 40 distributions being reported in the literature. These have been obtained by spectroscopic techniques integrated with flowing afterglows (FA) and using storage rings (SR). The data obtained by SR measurements are more extensive than those determined in the FA. Some data are available where the two techniques overlap, however here there are very significant differences. To resolve these contradictions, a new technique to quantitatively detect product neutrals has been developed. This technique is based on the FA and uses an electron impact (EI) ionizer to ionize the neutral products prior to detection by a quadrupole mass filter/electron multiplier. Two experimental methodologies, both using pulsed gas techniques, isolate and quantify the DR products. In one approach, an electron attaching gas is pulsed into the flow to transiently destroy electrons and thus quench DR. N2H+ recombination has been used as a test case and results from this approach give an upper limit of 5% for the NH + N product channel, the remainder being N2 + H. In the second approach, the reagent gas N2 is pulsed. Here the absolute percentages of products are monitored versus initial N2 concentration. Results from this approach also give an upper limit of 5% for NH + N production. This establishes that N2 + H is the dominant channel, being at least 95%, and that there is no significant NH production. This was contrary to a recent storage ring measurement which yielded 64% NH + N and 36% N2 + H. Note, that these values have changed due to a recent re-measurement of the DR revealing that the NH channel is not nearly as significant as originally thought. Additionally, the DR product distribution for CH5+ is reported and discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Titan's lower ionosphere (from 1 to 400 km) has been studied with a one-dimensional ion-neutral model. In this region of the atm., galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) are the main ionization source. They penetrate to the deeper atm. and ionize the neutral constituents of Titan's atm. (mainly N2, CH4, Ar, H2, and CO) to produce N2+, N+, Ar+, CH4+, CH3+, CH2+, H2+, H+, and CO+. Fast reactions with the neutrals convert these ions into ions such as CH5+, C2H5+, and N2H+. Different pathways are proposed to obtain the ion and electron densities. The most abundant ions are cluster ions, like CH5+.CH4, HCO+.H2, and HCNH+.C2H4, and long chain hydrocarbon ions. In atmospheres very rich in N2, such as Titan's, ions like H4C7N+ and CH3CNH+ also represent an important contribution to the total pos. ion d. Three-body reactions may play an important role in the dense atm. of Titan, and special attention is devoted to them. The calcd. electron d. in the lower atm. reaches a peak of ~ 2150 cm-3 at an altitude of 90 km. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  Abstract                 = {Cosmic ray radiation is the main mechanism for ionizing the lower atmosphere of Titan. Their higher penetration power, in comparison with solar photons, allows cosmic rays to penetrate deep into the atmosphere of Titan, ionizing the neutral molecules and generating an ionosphere with an electron density peak, placed at around 90 km, similar in magnitude to the ionospheric peak produced by solar radiation in the upper atmosphere. In the lower atmosphere, the electron density profile, in the absence of a magnetic field, depends mainly on the modulation of cosmic rays by the solar wind and on the nature of the ionizable particles. We present here the first results of a new numerical model developed to calculate the concentration of electrons and most abundant ions in the Titan lower atmosphere. The present knowledge of Titan's atmosphere permits us to include new neutral and ionic species, such as oxygen derivates, in a more detailed ion-chemistry calculation than previous lower ionospheric models of Titan. The electron density peaks at 90 km with a magnitude of 2150 cm-3. The ion distribution obtained predicts that cluster cations and hydrocarbon cations are the most abundant ions below and above the electron density peak, respectively. We also discuss the effect of solar activity at the distance of the Saturn orbit on the spectrum of the cosmic particles. We obtain that from solar minimum to solar maximum the ionization rate at the energy deposition peak changes by a factor of 1.2 at 70 km, and by a factor of 2.6 at altitudes as high as 400 km. The electron density at the concentration peak changes by a factor of 1.1 at 90 km, and by a factor of 1.6 at 400 km.},

  Abstract                 = {{The technique of H(D) atom photofragment translational spectroscopy has been applied to the photodissociation of CH4(CD4) at 121.6 nm. Contrary to the previous consensus view, we find simple C-H bond fission to be the dominant primary process following excitation at this wavelength. The resulting CH3 fragments are formed with very high levels of internal excitation: Some (approximately 25\%) possess so much internal energy that they must undergo subsequent unimolecular decay. The present experiments do not provide a unique determination of the products of this secondary decay process, but statistical arguments presented herein suggest that they will be predominantly CH and H-2 fragments. Similar considerations point to a significant role for the direct three body process yielding the same products H+H-2+CH. This overall pattern of energy disposal can be rationalized by assuming that most of the initially prepared CH4(A 1T2) molecules undergo rapid internal conversion (promoted by the Jahn-Teller distortion of this excited state) to high vibrational levels of the ground state prior to fragmentation. The realization that CH4 photodissociation at 121.6 nm yields CH3 (and CH) fragments, rather than methylene radicals, will necessitate some revision of current models of the hydrocarbon photochemistry prevailing in the atmospheres of the outer planets and some of their moons, notably Titan.}},

  Abstract                 = {We have elaborated an evolutionary turbulent model of the subnebula of Saturn derived from that of Dubrulle (1993, Icarus 106, 59-76) for the solar nebula, which is valid for a geometrically thin disk. We demonstrate that if carbon and nitrogen were in the form of CO and N2, resp., in the early subnebula, these mols. were not subsequently converted into CH4 and NH3 during the evolution of the disk, contrary to the current scenario initially proposed by Prinn and Fegley (1981, Astrophys. J., 249, 308-317). However, if the early subnebula contained some CH4 and NH3, these gases were not subsequently converted into CO and N2. We argue that Titan must have been formed from planetesimals migrating from the outer part of the subnebula to the present orbit of the satellite. These planetesimals were relics of those embedded in the feeding zone of Saturn prior to the completion of the planet and contained hydrates of NH3 and clathrate hydrates of CH4. It is shown that, for plausible abundances of CH4 and NH3 in the solar nebula at 10 AU, the masses of methane and nitrogen trapped in Titan were higher than the est. of masses of these components in the primitive atm. of the satellite. If our scenario is valid and if our turbulent model properly describes the structure and the evolution of the actual subnebula of Saturn, the Xe/C ratio should be six times higher in Titan's atm. today than in the Sun, while the current scenario would probably result in a quasi solar Xe/C ratio. The mass spectrometer and gas chromatograph instrument aboard the Huygens Titan probe of the Cassini mission has the capability of measuring this ratio in 2004, thus permitting us to discriminate between the current scenario and the one proposed in this report.

  Abstract                 = {A new interpretation of the D/H ratio in CH4 obsd. in the atm. of Titan is proposed. Using a turbulent evolutionary model of the subnebula of Saturn (O. Mousis et al. 2002), the authors show that in contrast to the current scenario, the deuterium enrichment with respect to the solar value obsd. in Titan cannot have occurred in the subnebula. Instead, values of the D/H ratio measured in Titan were obtained in the cooling solar nebula by isotopic thermal exchange of hydrogen with CH3D originating from interstellar methane D-enriched ices that vaporized in the nebula. The rate of the isotopic exchange decreased with temp. and became fully inhibited around 200 K. Methane was subsequently trapped in cryst. ices around 10 AU in the form of clathrate hydrates formed at 60 K, and incorporated into planetesimals that formed the core of Titan. The nitrogen-methane atm. was subsequently outgassed from the decompn. of the hydrates (Mousis et al. 2002). By use of a turbulent evolutionary model of the solar nebula (O. Mousis et al. 2000), the entire story of D/H in CH4 was reconstructed, from its high value in the early solar nebula (acquired in the presolar cloud) down to the value measured in Titan's atm. today. Considering the two last detns. of the D/H ratio in Titan [D/H = (7.75+-2.25) * 10-5 obtained from ground-based observations (Orton 1992) and D/H = (8.75+3.25-2.25) * 10-5, obtained from IR Space Observatory observations (Coustenis et al. 2002, submitted for publication)] an inferred upper limit of the D/H ratio in methane in the early outer solar nebula is taken as about 3 * 10-4. The approach used is consistent with the scenario advocated by several authors in which the atm. methane of Titan is continuously replenished from a reservoir of clathrate hydrates of CH4 at high pressures, located in the interior of Titan. If this scenario is correct, observations of the satellite to be performed by the radar, the imaging system, and other remote sensing instruments aboard the spacecraft of the Cassini-Huygens mission from 2004 to 2008 should reveal local disruptions of the surface and other signatures of the predicted outgassing.

  Abstract                 = {The Cassini Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) measures densities of gases including N2 and CH4 in situ in Titan's upper atmosphere. We have used data from 13 targeted flybys of Titan (T5&#8211;T32) to construct an empirical model that describes the mean state of the thermosphere in the northern hemisphere, giving the N2 and CH4 densities between 1000 and 1600 km as a function of latitude and height. The principal features in the INMS data are well reproduced by this simple model. We find a pronounced oblateness in the thermosphere, with densities above 1100 km altitude increasing by around 70% from the northern (winter) pole to the equator, resulting in isobaric surfaces being $\simeq$45 km higher over the equator than at the northern pole. Thermospheric temperatures derived from the densities tend to decrease with height from 149 ± 10 K to 140 ± 13 K near 1600 km. Considerable latitude differences are present in the temperatures below 1200 km. Near 1000 km altitude, temperatures reach 164 ± 6 K at 20°N and 131 ± 6 K near 80°N. Using our Thermosphere General Circulation Model with this thermal structure imposed, we derive thermospheric horizontal wind speeds reaching &#8764;150 m s&#8722;1, with primarily poleward flow at equatorial latitudes which, northward of around 60°N, is accompanied by a band of prograde zonal winds of up to 50 m s&#8722;1. At high latitudes, converging horizontal winds generate regions of strong subsistence. We find thermospheric dynamics to be sensitive to coupling from below. CH4 abundances are enhanced in the northern polar region, which may result from transport by thermospheric winds.},

  Abstract                 = {Using a time-dependent general circulation model of Titan's thermosphere, we calc. the global distribution of neutral gases by winds and diffusion. Our calcns. suggest that solar driven dynamics effectively redistribute constituents, causing considerable diurnal and seasonal changes in gas abundances. Subsidence causes an accumulation of lighter gases on the nightside, with nighttime CH4 mole fractions at equinox near 1400 km reaching up to 50%. The reverse happens on the dayside, where lighter gases are depleted, giving min. CH4 mole fractions near 1400 km of around 12%. The vertical transport time scales are around 5-10% of a Titan day, so these extrema in gas abundances are shifted with respect to local noon and midnight by up to 4 h Local Solar Time (LST). The strong horizontal variations in gas abundances, combined with the local time shifts of their extrema, have an important impact on the thermal structure and lead to a shift of the nighttime min. from local midnight towards early morning hours (0330 LST). This coupling between gas distribution and thermal structure on the nightside occurs via dynamical processes, primarily through changes in adiabatic heating. The redistribution of gases effectively controls, through changes in mean mol. wt., the pressure gradients, which in turn control the horizontal and vertical winds, and thereby adiabatic heating and cooling. On the dayside, changes in solar EUV absorption due to the redistributed gases occur but are comparatively small. Although it is possible with our calcns. to identify important processes, Voyager and ground based observations of Titan are currently not sufficient to constrain the dynamics of Titan's upper atm., but comparisons with forthcoming Cassini observations are highly anticipated.

The effects of exospheric mass loading, major chem. reactions, and ion-neutral collisions were considered. The upstream parameters were selected to be the nominal values for the case when Titan is in the magnetosphere of Saturn. The simulation results are compared with Voyager measurements as well as related model calcns. The 3-D three-species model results reproduce reasonably well the global features such as magnetic barrier, magnetotail, and the distributions of the major ionospheric species. The outward escape flux of the major ionospheric species (i.e., the heavy ion species), from the tail is calcd. to be approx. 6.5 * 1024 S-1. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  Abstract                 = {We present a comprehensive and self-consistent set of new atomic data for ionization balance in radiatively and collisionally ionized astrophysical plasmas. Complex resonant phenomena resulting in rapid energy variation in the cross sections for photoionization and recombination require accurate and large-scale calculations, as reported. Another new development is the consideration of the unified nature of the recombination process in an ab initio manner, via resonances embedded in the electron-ion continua, which have been heretofore considered as separate processes of radiative recombination and dielectronic recombination. A single set of total electron-ion recombination rate coefficients is thereby obtained as a function of electron temperature. The present calculations also meet the hitherto neglected, but theoretically essential, criterion of self-consistency between the rates for the inverse processes of photoionization and recombination, ensured by describing all atomic processes with an identical set of eigenfunction expansion within the close-coupling approximation using the $\mathstrut{{\bmi R}}$-matrix method. Photoionization cross sections and total electron-ion recombination rate coefficients for the carbon and nitrogen isonuclear sequences, C I–C VI and N I–N VII, are presented. Ionization fractions in coronal equilibrium are also computed. The present photoionization cross sections have been calculated using more extensive eigenfunction expansions than those in the Opacity Project. In addition to the total photoionization and recombination data, state-specific cross sections are also obtained for a large number of excited states for non-LTE models. Complete data sets are available electronically.},

Sepn. and identification of low-mol.-wt. hydrocarbons and nitriles (important prebiol. mols.) were carried out on dimethylpolysiloxane (DMPS) and 14% cyanopropylphenyl-86% dimethylpolysiloxane (CPPS-DMPS) column stationary phases. These phases were deposited as thin films on the inner surface of fused silica coated steel capillary columns. The interaction of hydrocarbons and nitriles with these phases was studied under various column inlet pressure and carrier gas flow conditions. The selectivity for nitriles was enhanced by using the CPPS-DMPS phase. On this phase, the modeling no. (log M) values varied linearly with the column temp. Pronounced differences were obsd. in the order of elution for C4 hydrocarbons between CPPS-DMPS and DMPS phases. On CPPS-DMPS phase, the retention time decreased as 1,3-butadiene > 1-butene > n-butane, whereas on DMPS phase the order was n-butane > 1,3-butadiene > 1-butene. With the exception of certain temp. intervals, the retention times of C4 hydrocarbons predicted by the thermodn. retention indexes model were comparable to exptl. detd. values. Exptl. and modeled retention times for benzene, toluene, and xylene, and nitriles also exhibited good agreement. Resoln. of C2 hydrocarbons on low-temp. glassy carbon phase was demonstrated for the 1st time by the GC/MS studies.

  Abstract                 = {The atmosphere of Titan is constantly bombarded by galactic cosmic rays and Saturnian magnetospheric electrons causing the formation of free electrons and primary ions, which are then stabilized by ion cluster formation and charging of aerosols. These charged particles accumulate in drops in cloud regions of the troposphere. Their abundance can substantially increase by friction, fragmentation or collisions during convective activity. Charge sepn. occurs with help of convection and gravitational settling leading to development of elec. fields within the cloud and between the cloud and the ground. Neutralization of these charged particles leads to corona discharges which are characterized by low current densities. These elec. discharges could induce a no. of chem. reactions in the troposphere and hence it is of interest to explore such effects. The authors exptl. studied the corona discharge of a simulated Titan's atm. (10% methane and 2% argon in nitrogen) at 500 Torr and 298 K by GC-FTIR-MS techniques. The main products have been identified as hydrocarbons (ethane, ethyne, ethene, propane, propene + propyne, cyclopropane, butane, 2-methylpropane, 2-methylpropene, n-butane, 2-butene, 2,2-dimethylpropane, 2-methylbutane, 2-methylbutene, n-pentane, 2,2-dimethylbutane, 2-methylpentane, 3-methylpentane, n-hexane, 2,2-dimethylhexane, 2,2-dimethylpentane, 2,2,3-trimethylbutane, 2,3-dimethylpentane and n-heptane), nitriles (hydrogen cyanide, cyanogen, ethanenitrile, propanenitrile, 2-methylpropanenitrile and butanenitrile) and an uncharacterized film deposit. Their trends of formation as a function of discharge time are presented and their initial yields of formation are derived. These results clearly demonstrate that a complex org. chem. can be initiated by corona processes in the lower atm. Although photochem. and charged particle chem. occurring in the stratosphere can account for many of the obsd. hydrocarbon species in Titan, the predicted abundance of ethene is too low by a factor of 10 to 40. While some ethene will be produced by charged-particle chem., its prodn. by corona processes and subsequent diffusion into the stratosphere appears to be an adequate source. Because little UV penetrates to the lower atm. to destroy the mols. formed there, the corona-produced species may be long-lived and contribute significantly to the compn. of the lower atm. and surface.

Here we examine the chem. effects of these elec. processes on a Titan simulated atm. composed of CH4 in N2 at various mixing ratios. Corona discharges were simulated in two different exptl. arrays. For the detection of reactive intermediates we used a mass spectrometer to study the main pos. ions arising by bombarding low-energy electrons from a hot filament into low-pressure methane. The final stable products, generated by applying a high voltage in a coaxial reactor with either pos. or neg. polarity, were sepd. and detected by gas chromatog.-Fourier transform IR spectroscopy and electron impact mass spectrometry (GC-FTIR-MS). Lightning discharges were simulated by a hot and dense plasma generated by a Nd-YAG laser and the final products were sepd. and detected by GC-FTIR-MS. Corona discharges produce linear and branched hydrocarbons as well as nitriles whereas lightning discharges generate mainly unsatd. hydrocarbons and nitriles. Lightning discharges are about 2 orders of magnitude more efficient in product formation than corona discharges. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  Abstract                 = {We have observed Titan in a series of campaigns from 1991 to 1996 with the Fourier Transform Spectrometer on the CFH telescope. The data acquired provide a lightcurve from the geometric albedos in the 0.9- spectral region. The 1991-1993 data were previously analyzed in Coustenis et al. [1995. Titan's surface: composition and variability from its near-infrared albedo. Icarus 118, 87-104] with a spherical particle code by McKay et al. [1989. The thermal structure of Titan's atmosphere. Icarus 80, 23-53]. We present here three new datasets from the 1994, 1995 and 1996 observations, with additional information from the 0.94-[mu]m methane window on Titan. All the data (1991-1996) are re-analyzed in this work using an updated radiative transfer code based on Rannou et al. [2003. A model of Titan's haze of fractal aerosols constrained by multiple observations. Planet. Space Sci. 51, 963-976] with fractal particles. A comparative study of methane absorption coefficients currently available from different sources is also performed demonstrating the great sensitivity of surface inferences to this model parameter. Based on our results, we recommend the methane absorption coefficients produced by Boudon et al. [2006. The vibrational levels of methane obtained from analyses of high-resolution spectra. J. Quant. Spectrosc. 98, 394-404.] and Irwin et al. [2006. Improved near-infrared methane band models and k-distribution parameters from 2000 to and implications for interpretation of outer planet spectra. Icarus 181, 309-319.] for future studies of Titan. The geometric albedos have been reproduced with our model. We have tested different types of haze profiles and inferred the impact of this parameter on the retrieval of surface albedos. The latter are finally proposed in the atmospheric methane windows centered at 0.94, 1.075, 1.28, 1.6 and for each of the methane coefficient sets. The surface albedos proposed here are not just points at the center of the windows but curves covering a large portion of these regions. This is useful for studies of the composition of the Titan surface. Indeed, we find our data to be compatible with mixtures of water ice and tholin but have strong indication for the presence of an additional, as yet unidentified, component (or components) for which we offer a spectral description. We also discuss the implications of the surface albedo retrievals (as a disk average) for the surface of Titan, recently investigated by the Cassini-Huygens mission.},

  Abstract                 = {A spectrophotometric observational study of the Galilean satellites and Titan was carried out at 0.004-mm resoln. over the spectral range 0.32 to 0.86 mm. A std. lunar area was used as a primary spectroscopic std. to establish the relative reflection spectra of the objects by ratioing the sky-cor. satellite spectra to the std. area on the moon. Io was a spectral edge at 0.3o mm that has not been previously reported. The increase in reflectivity from 0.4 to 0.5 mm and the band at 0.56 mm are confirmed. A weak band at 0.56 mm is probable on Europa and possible on Ganymede. Callisto shows no spectral features that have not been previously reported. On Titan, no temporal variations in the CH4 bands >2% were found, indicating that the effective path length in the Titan atm. did not change over the 3-mo period of this study. [on SciFinder (R)]},

The GCMS also analyzes gas samples from the aerosol collector pyrolyzer (ACP) and may be able to investigate the compn. (including isotope ratios) of several candidate surface materials. The GCMS is a quadrupole mass filter with a secondary electron multiplier detection system and a gas sampling system providing continuous direct atm. compn. measurements and batch sampling through three gas chromatog. (GC) columns. The mass spectrometer employs five ion sources sequentially feeding the mass analyzer. Three ion sources serve as detectors for the GC columns and two are dedicated to direct atm. sampling and ACP gas sampling resp. The instrument is also equipped with a chem. scrubber cell for noble gas anal. and a sample enrichment cell for selective measurement of high b.p. carbon contg. constituents. The mass range is 2-141 Dalton and the nominal detection threshold is at a mixing ratio of 10-8. The data rate available from the Probe system is 885 bit/s.

  Abstract                 = {HCN and n-C6H14 were found exptl. to be trapped in water ice, when codeposited with water vapor on a cold plate, at 140 K and CH3OH even at 160 K. At these temps., at least part of the water ice is cryst. These three gases have relatively high sublimation temps., whereas the gases studied earlier, Ar, Kr, Xe, CO, CH4, and N2, which have lower sublimation temps., are trapped only in amorphous water ice, up to .apprx. 100 K. It seems that the major factor detg. the efficiency of gas trapping by water ice, during codeposition of a gas-water vapor mixt. on a cold plate, is the sublimation temps. of the gases to be trapped. Those with a high sublimation temp. remain, during codeposition, longer in the pores of the water ice which are open to the surface, until they are covered by addnl. ice layers. Only methanol seems to form a clathrate hydrate, in agreement with the exptl. results of D. Blake et al. (1991), which points to the importance of the interaction of the gas mols. with the water mols. in the ice. Consequently, comets and icy satellites that were formed in the Jupiter-Saturn region and their sub nebulas could trap CH3OH, HCN, and heavy hydrocarbons, whereas comets and icy satellites that were formed in the Uranus-Neptune region, at the outskirts of the Saturnian sub nebulas (Titan), and beyond the planets in the Kuiper belt could trap also gases having lower sublimation temps.

With the EMU imaging detector we succeeded to observe the branching ratios after DR of deuterated hydronium ions D3O+ at energies of 0â0.5 and 4â21 eV. The branching ratios are almost constant at low energies while above 6 eV both oxygen-producing channels O + D + D + D and O + D2 + D strongly increase and dominate by about 85% at 11 eV. To demonstrate further capabilities of our fragment imaging detectors, we also summarize some of our additional recent studies on DR of molecular ions important for astrophysics as well as for fundamental unimolecular dynamics.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we present a method of nesting Dirichlet distributions, which ultimately gen-
eralizes the Generalized Dirichlet distribution. We denote the resulting underlying distribution
a nested Dirichlet distribution. We begin by providing some basic intuition for understanding
the distribution as well as presenting some useful notation, the joint probability distribution
function, and formulae for several properties of the distribution, such as the covariance matrix
for all variables. We also discuss the close relationship of the distribution with the Generalized
Dirichlet, show how to ¯t the distribution given multinomial data using Maximum Likelihood
Estimators, and present an analysis of the accuracy and bias of these estimators using Cramer-
Rao bounds.
Subsequently we evaluate a data mining method to estimate the nesting structure of this
distribution using simulated multinomial data. In our example, this method generally discovers
the correct nesting structure. Further, forecasting using this ¯tted distribution (given data
simulated from a nested Dirichlet underlying distribution) improve predictive power over the

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we present a method of nesting Dirichlet distributions, which ultimately gen-
eralizes the Generalized Dirichlet distribution. We denote the resulting underlying distribution
a nested Dirichlet distribution. We begin by providing some basic intuition for understanding
the distribution as well as presenting some useful notation, the joint probability distribution
function, and formulae for several properties of the distribution, such as the covariance matrix
for all variables. We also discuss the close relationship of the distribution with the Generalized
Dirichlet, show how to ¯t the distribution given multinomial data using Maximum Likelihood
Estimators, and present an analysis of the accuracy and bias of these estimators using Cramer-
Rao bounds.
Subsequently we evaluate a data mining method to estimate the nesting structure of this
distribution using simulated multinomial data. In our example, this method generally discovers
the correct nesting structure. Further, forecasting using this ¯tted distribution (given data
simulated from a nested Dirichlet underlying distribution) improve predictive power over the
Dirichlet twice as much as the Generalized Dirichlet does.},

  Abstract                 = {The Dirichlet family owes its privileged status within simplex distributions to easyness of interpretation and good mathematical properties. In particular, we recall fundamental properties for the analysis of compositional data such as closure under amalgamation and subcomposition. From a probabilistic point of view, it is characterised (uniquely) by a variety of independence relationships which makes it indisputably the reference model for expressing the non trivial idea of substantial independence for compositions. Indeed, its well known inadequacy as a general model for compositional data stems from such an independence structure together with the poorness of its parametrisation. In this paper a new class of distributions (called Flexible Dirichlet) capable of handling various dependence structures and containing the Dirichlet as a special case is presented. The new model exhibits a considerably richer parametrisation which, for example, allows to model the means and (part of) the variance-covariance matrix separately. Moreover, such a model preserves some good mathematical properties of the Dirichlet, i.e. closure under amalgamation and subcomposition with new parameters simply related to the parent composition parameters. Furthermore, the joint and conditional distributions of subcompositions and relative totals can be expressed as simple mixtures of two Flexible Dirichlet distributions. The basis generating the Flexible Dirichlet, though keeping compositional invariance, shows a dependence structure which allows various forms of partitional dependence to be contemplated by the model (e.g. non-neutrality, subcompositional dependence and subcompositional non-invariance), independence cases being identified by suitable parameter configurations. In particular, within this model substantial independence among subsets of components of the composition naturally occurs when the subsets have a Dirichlet distribution.},

The geochem. activities displayed by these anaerobes impact the global cycling of certain elements (e.g., C, N, S, Fe, Mn). Methane provides an obvious example of how human-enhanced activities on a global scale can influence the content of a \"radiative\" (i.e., IR absorbing) trace gas in the atm. Methane can be oxidized by anaerobic bacteria, but this does not appear to support their growth. Acetylene, however, does support such growth. This may form the basis for future exobiol. investigations of the atmospheres of anoxic, hydrocarbon-rich planets like Jupiter and Saturn, as well as the latter's satellite Titan.

  Abstract                 = {The dissociative recombination reaction between HC3NH+ and electrons is an important process in the chemistry of interstellar clouds. Motivated by the evidence that HCN and its metastable isomer HNC are both formed via the dissociative recombination reaction of HCNH+, we have examined the potential energy surface for the dissociation of the transient HC3NH following the recombination between HC3NH+ and electrons. We find that HC3NH+ gains 151 kcal mol-1 energy by the neutralization; this energy is high enough to isomerize HC3NH to HCCNCH, as well as to dissociate a hydrogen atom from either end of the molecule. The present calculation suggests, therefore, that the metastable linear and near-linear isomers of HC3N, namely, HNC3, HCCNC, and HCNCC, can be formed via the dissociative recombination between HC3NH+ and electrons. Two of these isomers, HNC3 and HCCNC, have already been detected in the dark cloud TMC-1. The unobserved species HCNCC is energetically the least stable. Since interstellar HC3N molecules are synthesized predominantly via neutral-neutral reactions, the HC3NH+ + e- process serves mainly to produce the metastable isomers of HC3N. We have incorporated these reaction products, as well as other relevant ion-molecule and neutral-neutral reactions, into our new standard model of dense interstellar clouds. Our model results show that the observed abundances in TMC-1 of HC3N, its two detected metastable isomers, and the related species C3H, C3N, and HC3NH+ can, in the main, be reproduced.},

Rate coefficients have been obtained by using the pulsed laser photolysis-laser induced fluorescence technique, where both radicals were produced at the same time but detected separately. The reactivity of the triplet state was found to be significantly lower than that of the singlet ground state for all reactants over the whole temperature range of the study. Whereas C2(X1£g+) reacts with a rate coefficient close to the gas kinetic limit with all hydrocarbons studied apart from CH4, C2(a3 u) appears to be more sensitive to the molecular and electronic structure of the reactant partners. The latter reacts at least one order of magnitude faster with unsaturated hydrocarbons than with alkanes, and the rate coefficients increase very significantly with the size of the alkane.

However, this test is frequently found to be too sensitive for flow cytometric histogram comparisons. Here, a parametric alternative to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is proposed that is based on fitting suitable models to flow cytometric data. Methods: Several flow cytometric histograms derived from cell surface immunophenotyping for intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) on K562 cells were analyzed using numerical modeling. The prediction intervals derived from the modeling were used for decision making. Results: The residuals after peak fitting flow cytometric data are normally distributed and this permits the use of the prediction limit methodology. The usefulness of the approach for analyzing flow cytometry histograms is examined and the method is shown to avoid the "sensitivity" disadvantages associated with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Conclusions: The prediction limit method is a viable alternative to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov method.},

The source of dissociating and probe radiation is one and the same (delay time <= 20 nsec). The average translational energy of ejected hydrogen atoms (50 Kcal/mol) reveals that CH4 + hv -> CH3 + H(S-2) and CH4 + hv -> CH2(a(1)A(1)) + H-2((1)Sigma(g)) are the main dissociation processes. The absolute quantum yield for CH4 and CD4 are the same, Phi(H)(CH4) = Phi(D)(CD4) = 0.31 +/- 0.05. If one divides the experimental H/D ratios from the isotopomers CH3D, CH2D2, CHD3 by the isotopic HID ratios, a value 2 is obtained in all three cases.

  Abstract                 = {The late Archean atm. was probably rich in biol. generated CH4 and may well have contained a hydrocarbon haze layer similar to that obsd. today on Saturn's moon, Titan. Here we present a detailed model of the photochem. of haze formation in the early atm., and we examine the effects of such a haze layer on climate and UV radiation. We show that the thickness of the haze layer was limited by a neg. feedback loop: A haze optical depth of more than .apprx.0.5 in the visible would have produced a strong \"antigreenhouse effect,\" thereby cooling the surface and slowing the rate at which CH4 was produced. Given this climatic constraint on its visible optical depth, the amt. of UV shielding provided by the haze can be estd. from knowledge of the optical properties and size distribution of the haze particles. Contrary to previous studies [Sagan and Chyba, 1997], we find that when the finite size of the particles is taken into account, the amt. of UV shielding provided by the haze is small. Thus NH3 should have been rapidly photolyzed and should not have been sufficiently abundant to augment the atm. greenhouse effect. We also examine the question of whether photosynthetically generated O2 could have accumulated beneath the haze layer. For the model parameters considered here, the answer is \"no\": The upper limit on ground level O2 concns. is .apprx.10-6 atm, and a more realistic est. for pO2 during the late Archean is 10-8 atm. The stability of both O2 and NH3 is sensitive to the size distribution and optical properties of the haze particles, neither of which is well known. Further theor. and lab. work is needed to address these uncertainties. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  Abstract                 = {High concns. of greenhouse gases would have been required to offset low solar luminosity early in Earth's history. Enhanced CO2 levels are probably at least part of the soln., but CH4 may have played a significant role as well, particularly during the Late Archean era, 2.5-3.0 Ga, when methanogenic bacteria were almost certainly present. Indeed, biol. CH4 prodn. should have led to CO2 drawdown by way of a neg. feedback loop involving the carbonate-silicate geochem. cycle. We suggest here that the atm. CH4/CO2 ratio approached the value of .apprx.1 needed to trigger formation of Titan-like org. haze. This haze was strongly depleted in 13C relative to 12C and was produced at a rate comparable to the modern rate of org. carbon burial in marine sediments. Therefore, it could provide a novel explanation for the presence of extremely low-13C kerogens in Late Archean sediments. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  Abstract                 = {HNC is a major product of the dissociative recombination reaction of the important ionospheric ion HCNH+, although to date this neutral has not been identified within Titan's atmosphere, nor considered as a component in ionospheric or photochemical models. We have studied a simple pseudo-steady-state model for the formation and removal of HNC, in which the loss processes considered are HNC protonation by reaction with H-bearing ions; reaction with H atoms, yielding HCN; reaction with CH3 radicals, to form CH3CN; and reaction with a population of unidentified X radicals to yield further hypothesized products. Using the ion abundances of C. N. Keller et al. (1998, Planet. Space Sci.46, 1157-1174) and of M. Banaszkiewicz et al. (2000, Icarus147, 386-404), we find that the most important loss processes are the reactions with CH3 and with other unidentified radicals. According to our calculations, the HNC concentration reaches a peak of 104-105 molecules per cubic centimeter at an altitude of 1000-1100 km (i.e., close to the ionospheric peak), but is very much reduced at lower altitudes. We find also that the HNC/HCN ratio in Titan's atmosphere may approach unity at the ionization peak altitude and above. We discuss prospects for the detection of HNC, or its reaction products, during the Cassini mission.},

  Abstract                 = {To study Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, lab. simulation expts. have been performed to obtain analogs of Titan's aerosols (named tholins) using different energy sources. Tholins, which have been demonstrated to represent aerosols in Titan's haze layers, are a complex mixt. resulting from the chem. evolution of several hydrocarbons and nitriles. Chromatog. anal. yields complex chromatograms which require the use of math. procedures to ext. all the information contained therein. Two different chemometric approaches (the Fourier anal. approach and a statistical model of peak overlapping) were successfully applied to the pyrolysis-GC-MS chromatogram of a tholin sample. Fundamental information on the mixt.'s chem. compn. (no. of components, m) and on the sepn. system performance (sepn. efficiency, s) can be easily estd.; the excellent correspondence between the data calcd. by the two independent procedures proves the reliability of the statistical approaches in characterizing a tholin chromatogram. Moreover, the plot of autocorrelation function contains, in a simplified form, all the information on the retention pattern; retention recursivities can be easily singled out and related to specific mol. structure variations. Therefore, the autocorrelation function (ACF) plot constitutes a simplified fingerprint of the pyrolysis products of tholins, which can be used as a powerful tool to characterize a tholin sample.

Applications to combustion present particular problems because the conditions required can be well outside the ranges of temperature and pressure accessible to experiment, and the rate data can show a complex dependence on conditions. Under these conditions, the interplay between theory and experiment becomes important.},

The real part of the complex index is taken to be 2.0. The model assumes that the mixing ratio of Axel dust to gas is uniform above the surface of Titan. The same set of phys. properties for Axel dust also produces a good fit to Saturn's albedo if text = 0.7 at 5000 .ANG.. To match the increase in albedo shortward of 3500 .ANG., a clear layer (contg. about 7 km-am H2) is required above the Axel dust. Such a layer is also required to explain the limb brightening in the UV. These models can be used to analyze the obsd. equiv. widths of the visible CH4 bands. The anal. yields an abundance of the order of 1000 m-am CH4 in Titan's atm. The derived CH4/H2 mixing ratio for Saturn is about 3.5 x 10-3 or an enhancement of about 5 over the solar ratio.

  Abstract                 = {An attempt was made to bound the wavelength-averaged phase integrals and bolometric albedos of Uranus and Neptune by fitting a wide range of aerosol model atmospheres to their obsd. geometric albedo spectra. These models are characterized by an upper haze layer of finite optical depth and a lower cloud layer of infinite optical depth at discrete altitudes. Alternative models differ in the assumed value of the particles' single scattering phase function and the wavelength dependence of the haze optical depth. Phase functions ranging from isotropic to those characteristic of particles in the atmospheres of Titan, Jupiter, and Saturn are considered. The models of Uranus were partially tested by comparing the dependence of their disk-integrated brightness on phase angle with that derived from a combination of ground-based and Voyager 1 data that span phase angles of 0-85 Deg and by comparing their predicted shapes of several H2 quadrupole lines with obsd. shapes. Predictions of the Neptune models were compared with detns. of the planet's disk-integrated brightness at 0-48 Deg phase angle. The derived model parameters lie within useful bounds. In the case of Uranus, the cloud pressure for all 7 models considered falls between 2.2 and 2.5 bars, implying CH4 mixing ratios in the deeper portion of the atm. that are >=30 times higher than expected from solar elemental abundances if the cloud is interpreted as being a CH4 condensation cloud. The range of haze pressure (?0.5 bars) and optical depth (0.06-0.6 at 0.6435 mm) imply that haze aerosols are a significant absorber of sunlight and hence constitute a significant heating source in Uranus's upper troposphere and stratosphere. The results imply that the meteor. regimes in the observable atmospheres of Uranus and Neptune may be very different, with internal heat flux playing a more important role for Neptune than for Uranus.

Also, optical emissions have been detected at ~100 K from the N2(B3g) electronically excited products of N2H+/N2D+ recombination. The measurements were carried out using the classic FALP technique combined with an optical monochromator. For N2H+, there was no variation of e with temperature above 200 K, with an average value of e(N2H+) = 2.8 × 10-7 cm3 s-1. The temperature variation for T ~ 100-300 K observed for e(HCO+) is similar to that of N2H+ ions for T ~ 300-500 K. The smaller rate coefficient measured for DCO+ and N2D+ ions shows the influence of an isotope effect. The substantial enhancement of the vibrational level, ' = 6, from the N2B state for N2H+ recombination over N2D+ recombination is consistent with previous result at 300 K and implies the influence of a tunneling mechanism of DR.},

  Abstract                 = {Bayesian methods are experiencing increased use for probabilistic ecological modelling. Most Bayesian inference requires the numerical approximation of analytically intractable integrals. Two methods based on Monte Carlo simulation have appeared in the ecological/environmental modelling literature. Though they sound similar, the Bayesian Monte Carlo (BMC) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are very different in their efficiency and effectiveness in providing useful approximations for accurate inference in Bayesian applications. We compare these two methods using a low-dimensional biochemical oxygen demand decay model as an example. We demonstrate that the BMC is extremely inefficient because the prior parameter distribution, from which the Monte Carlo sample is drawn, is often a poor surrogate for the posterior parameter distribution, particularly if the parameters are highly correlated. In contrast, MCMC generates a chain that converges, in distribution, on the posterior parameter distribution, that can be regarded as a sample from the posterior distribution. The inefficiency of the BMC can lead to marginal posterior parameter distributions that appear irregular and may be highly misleading because the important region of the posterior distribution may never be sampled. We also point out that a priori specification of the model error variance can strongly influence the estimation of the principal model parameters. Although the BMC does not require that the model error variance be specified, most published applications have treated this variance as a known constant. Finally, we note that most published BMC applications have chosen a uniform prior distribution, making the BMC more similar to a likelihood-based inference rather than a Bayesian method because the posterior is unaffected by the prior. Though other prior distributions could be applied, the treatment of Monte Carlo samples with any other choice of prior distribution has not been discussed in the BMC literature.},

  Abstract                 = {The yield of metastable nitrogen atoms in dissociative recombination of N2+ (v = 0, 1)ions has been tudied for different experimental conditions. In a first experiment, the branching ratio for N(2D) production was directly measured as being higher than 1.85; for N2+ (v = 0) this implies that 2D + 2D is the main reaction channel; for N2+ (v = 1) a minor channel could be 2P + 2D, 2P being then quenched toward 2D by electrons. In a second experiment, at higher electron densities, the influence of superelastic collisions was studied; a steady state analysis yields the quenching rate coefficient k4, of 2D towards 4S equal to 2.4 × 10-10 cm3 s-1for Te = 3900 K and shows that 2D + 2D is always the major channel of the reaction for N2+ (v = 1), 2D + 2P being a minor channel. All these results are in good agreement with thermospheric models but imply that N2+ dissociative recombination is a less important source for nitrogen escape of Mars.},

  Abstract                 = {We review the distributional transform of a random variable, some of its applications, and some related multivariate distributional transformations. The distributional transform is a useful tool, which allows in many respects to deal with general distributions in the same way as with continuous distributions. In particular it allows to give a simple proof of Sklar's theorem in the general case. It has been used in the literature for stochastic ordering results. It is also useful for an adequate definition of the conditional value at risk measure and for many further purposes. We also discuss the multivariate quantile transform as well as the multivariate extension of the distributional transform and some of their applications. In the final section we consider an application to an extension of a limit theorem for the empirical copula process, also called empirical dependence function, to general not necessarily continuous distributions. This is useful for constructing and analyzing tests of dependence properties for general distributions.},

The primary products of these chem. interactions evolve to heavier org. compds. that are likely to assoc. into the particles of haze layers that hide Titan's surface. The different theories and models that have been put forward to explain the characteristics and properties of the haze composites require a knowledge of their optical properties, which are detd. by the complex refractive index. We present a new set of values for refractive index n and extinction coeff. k calcd. directly from the transmittance and reflectance curves exhibited by a lab. analog of (tholin-like nitrogen-methane reaction products) Titan's aerosols in the 200-900 nm range. Improvements in the aerosol analog quality have been made. The effects of variables such as the uncertainty in sample thickness, aerosol porosity, and amt. of scattered light on the final n and k values are assessed and discussed. Within the studied wavelength domain, n varies from 1.53 to 1.68 and k varies from 2.62*10-4 to 2.87*10-2. These final n and k values should be considered as a new ref. to modelers who compute the properties of Titan's aerosols in trying to explain the atm. dynamics and surface characteristics.

  Abstract                 = {A new approach is presented applicable in framework of model calibration to observed data. The approach consists of a combination of the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation technique (GLUE) and Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA). The method is based on multiple model evaluations. The GSA is a quantitative, model independent approach and is based on estimating the fractional contribution of each input factor to the variance of the model output, also accounting for interaction terms. In GLUE, the model runs are classified according to a likelihood measure, conditioning each run to observations. In calibration procedures, strong interaction is observed between model parameters, due to model over-parameterization. The use of likelihood measures allows an estimate of the posterior joint pdf of parameters. By performing a GSA to the likelihood measure, input factors mainly driving model runs with good fit to data are identified. Moreover GSA allows highlighting the basic features of the interaction structure. Any other tool subsequently adopted to represent in more detail the interaction structure, from correlation coefficients to Principal Component Analysis to Bayesian networks to tree-structured density estimation, confirms the general features identified by GSA.},

  Abstract                 = {UV induced syntheses of org. compds. from the main atm. constituents can be a very important source of org compds. in a given planetary environment provided the atm. is in a reduced state. The evolution of a CO2-rich medium only produces very low yields of formaldehyde and related oxygenated compds. Considering a CO-rich atm., the photochem. yield of O-orgs. formation is much higher, when the synthesis of N-orgs. remains difficult. The most favorable atm. as far as photochem. org. synthesis is concerned is a CH4-rich milieu. The photochem. evolution of such a CH4 atmosphere under UV irradn. leads to a chain of various orgs., the complexity of which increases together with the no. of pathways involved in their formation. Their complexity also closely correlates with their UV photoabsorption spectrum: the more complex they are, the more shifted is their UV spectrum toward the visible range. Direct photodissocn. of methane requires UV photons of wavelengths shorter than about 145 nm. It mainly produces ethane, which absorbs UV at wavelengths shorter than about 160 nm, and acetylene, that presents an absorption spectrum extending up to 200 nm. This shift still continuously increases with further increase in no. of C atoms. Unsatd. hydrocarbons with 4 and more C atoms have UV absorption characteristics including noticeable band structures in the 250-300 nm range. This trend has very important implication in the photochem. behavior of a CH4-rich planetary atm., as it induces many catalytic processes. The occurrence of such processes is closely related to vertical atm. and energy deposition profiles. Titan provides a very good example of such a UV-directed org. atm. chem. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  Abstract                 = {A review, with 38 refs., on the microphys. model of Titan's aerosols and the thermodn. model of Titan's oceans. Microphys. modeling shows that in the low atm. the aerosols would be constituted of a nucleus of several 10 m mean diam., mainly composed of nitriles, and covered by a thick layer of propane, ethane, and methane. After pptn. of these aerosols down to the surface, a fraction of their org. material must dissolve in Titan's ocean. Thermodn. modeling of the ocean indicates that this low temp. liq. mileu should include high concns. of various orgs. Thus, prebiotic chem. on Titan appears to be governed by atm. processes in an atm. free of O-contg. orgs., and by org. processes in a cryogenic apolar solvent. It must have followed a way very different from the terrestrial one. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  Abstract                 = {The statistical analysis of compositional data is of fundamental importance to practitioners in general and to chemists in particular. The existing methodology is principally due to Aitchison, who effectively uses two transformations, a ratio followed by the logarithmic, to create a useful, coherent theory that in principle allows the plethora of normal-based multivariate techniques to be used on the transformed data. This paper suggests that the well-known class of Box-Cox transformations can be employed in place of the logarithmic to significantly improve the existing methodology. This is supported in part by showing that one of the most basic problems that Aitchison managed to overcome, namely the specification of an interpretable covariance structure for compositional data, can be resolved, or nearly resolved, once the ratio transformation has been applied. Hence the resolution is not directly dependent on the logarithmic transformation. It is then verified that access to the general Box-Cox family will allow a more accurate use of the normal-based multivariate techniques, simply because better fits to normality can be achieved. Finally, maximum likelihood estimation and some associated asymptotics are employed to construct confidence intervals for ratios of the true, unknown compositional constituents. Heretofore this had not been done even in the context of the logarithmic transformation. Applications to real data are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a general approach to describe large amplitude motions (LAM) with multiple degrees of freedom (DOF) in molecules or reaction intermediates, which is useful for the computation of thermochemical or kinetic data. The kinetic part of the LAM Lagrangian is derived using a Z-matrix internal coordinate representation within a new numerical procedure. This derivation is exact for a classical system, and the uncertainties on the prediction of observable quantities largely arise from uncertainties on the LAM potential energy surface (PES) itself. In order to rigorously account for these uncertainties, we present an approach based on Bayesian theory to infer a parametrized physical model of the PES using ab initio calculations. This framework allows for quantification of uncertainties associated with a PES model as well as the forward propagation of these uncertainties to the quantity of interest. A selection and generalization of some treatments accounting for the coupling of the LAM with other internal or external DOF are also presented. Finally, we discuss and validate the approach with two applications: the calculation of the partition function of 1,3-butadiene and the calculation of the high-pressure reaction rate of the CH(3) + H → CH(4) recombination.},

Lab. evidence suggests that polycyclic arom. hydrocarbons contg. nitrogen atoms are formed during simulations of Titan's atm. This paper presents preliminary work on reactions that produce nitrogenated arom. mols. contg. up to 12 nonhydrogen atoms. These species would help bridge the gap between the small mols. and the aerosols in Titan's stratosphere. We have detd. the barriers and reaction energies for the incorporation of nitrogen into the rings of polycyclic arom. hydrocarbons. The presence of a nitrogen atom increases the barrier heights relative to the pure hydrocarbon species to about 15 kcal/mol. Nitrogen in the ring promotes the formation of addnl. hydrocarbon rings by lowering the ring closing barrier to about 4 kcal/mol. Inclusion of these species in photochem. models of Titan is indicated. (c) 2001 Academic Press. [on SciFinder (R)]},

The heat of reaction is predicted to be exothermic by 5.4 kcal mol-1 and the barrier height is 0.2 kcal mol-1 at the QCISD(T)/6-311++G(2df,2p)//UMP2/6-311G92df,2p) level of theory.

Twenty-one different codes participated in the comparison and results for up to 35 test cases with elements throughout the periodic table and two astrophysical mixtures were submitted prior to the meeting. There were 485 individual plasma calculations with about 150 Mbytes of information submitted. At the meeting, radiative opacities were compared in detail and differences in calculated results were traced back to the physics input such that their origin became transparent. A review of these comparisons is given and detailed comparisons for some of the test cases are presented.},

At lower (<1100 km) altitudes, the total ion densities measured by the INMS are less than the electron densities measured by the RPWS/LP which could be due to heavy (>100 daltons) ions, which the INMS is not able to detect. Qualitatively, INMS spectra exhibit the same ion species and 12 amu family separations for the dayside ionospheres of T17 and T18 as were seen in the mass spectra measured during T5 (nightside). However, the relative abundance of high mass (m > 50) ion species is about 10 times less for the dayside T17 and T18 passes than it was for the polar nightside T5 flyby, which can perhaps be explained in several ways including differences in neutral composition, less dissociative recombination on the nightside than on the dayside (due to lower electron densities and affecting heavier ion species more than lighter ones), and transport of longer-lived high mass species from day to night.},

Models of methane photolysis on Titan suggest that the atm. inventory of methane would have been depleted many thousand fold over the age of the solar system. It has been proposed that methane is stored in the porous water ice regolith (the hidden ocean model). We have measured the uptake of methane on ice films that simulate the regolith from 85 K to about 100K and find that the uptake of methane is greatly enhanced by capillary absorption into smaller pores via the Kelvin effect and by multilayer phys. adsorption. The relative methane humidity at which capillary absorption begins is very sensitive to temp. Sufficient quantities of methane could be stored to buffer the photolytic loss. The effect of ice structure on uptake and on other processes such as water desorption flux will also be described. [on SciFinder (R)]},

We collected dielec. const. values for the Cassini radar wavelength (.apprx.2.2 cm) for materials of interest for Titan: liq. methane, liq. mixt. of methane-ethane, water ice, and light hydrocarbon ices. Due to the lack of permittivity values for Titan's haze particles in the microwave range, we performed dielec. const. (.vepsiln.r) measurements around 2.2 cm on tholins synthesized in lab. We obtained a real part of .vepsiln.r in the range of 2-2.5 and a loss tangent between 10-3 and 5*10-2. By combining aerosol distribution models (with hypothetical condensation at low altitudes) to surface models, we find the following results: (1) Aerosol-only atmospheres should cause no loss and are essentially transparent for Cassini radar, as expected by former anal. (2) However, if clouds are present, some atm. models generate significant attenuation that can reach -50 dB, well below the sensitivity threshold of the receiver. In such cases, a 13.78 GHz radar would not be able to measure echoes coming from the surface. We thus warn about possible risks of misinterpretation if a \"wet atm.\" is not taken into account. (3) Rough surface scattering leads to a typical response of .apprx.-17 dB. These results will have important implications on future Cassini radar data anal. [on SciFinder (R)]},

The energy dependence of the cross-section below 0.1 eV is found to be much steeper than the E-1 behaviour associated with the dominance of the direct recombination mechanism. Resonant structures found at 4 eV and 11 eV have been attributed to the electron capture to Rydberg states converging to electronically excited ionic states. Complete branching fractions for all dissociation channels have been measured at a collision energy of 0 eV. The dissociation process is dominated by three-body H + H + O breakup that occurs with a branching ratio of 0.71.},

  Abstract                 = {We review the critical results of the 4th Non-LTE Code Comparison Workshop held in December 2005. To test the NLTE population kinetics codes, both steady-state and time-dependent cases for C, Ar, Fe, Sn, Xe, and Au plasmas were selected for detailed comparisons. Additional features such as the effects of non-Maxwellian free electrons, the influence of a Planckian radiation field, and the emission spectra were required in specific cases. The scope of problems was expanded from the previous workshops to include two problems outside the dense plasma physics, namely, the EUV lithography sources and the astrophysical photoionized plasmas. We briefly outline the technical organization of the workshop, present motivations for the chosen cases, and discuss some representative results.},

We examined the reasons for this temperature dependence through a combined experimental and theoretical study of the reactions of O(3P) atoms with a range of alkenes. The factors that control the rate coefficients were shown to be rather subtle, but excellent agreement was obtained between the experimental results and microcanonical transition state theory calculations based on ab initio representations of the potential energy surfaces describing the interaction between the reactants.},

The resulting integrated synthesis rates of org. products range from 102-103 g/cm2 over 4.5 * 106 yr for high-energy particle sources to 1.3 * 104 g/cm2 for UV at l < 1550 .ANG., and to 5.0 * 105 g/cm2 if l > 1550 .ANG. (acting primarily on C2H2, C2H4, and C4H2) is included. The prodn. rate curves show no localized max. corresponding to obsd. altitudes of Titan's hazes and clouds. For simple to moderately complex org. gases in the Titanian atm., condensation occurs below the top of the main cloud deck at 2825 km. Such condensates comprise the principal cloud mass, with mols. of greater complexity condensing at higher altitudes. The scattering optical depths of the condensates of mols. produced in the Titanian mesosphere are .ltorsim.102/(particulate radius, mm) if column densities of condensed and gas phases are comparable. Visible condensation hazes of more complex org. compds. may occur at altitudes .ltorsim.3060 km provided only that the abundance of org. products declines with mol. mass no faster than lab. expts. indicate.

  Abstract                 = {Fundamental knowledge of the elementary reaction mechanisms involved in oxygenate decomposition on transition metal catalysts can facilitate the optimization of future catalyst and reactor systems for biomass upgrade to fuels and chemicals. Pt-catalyzed decomposition of glycolaldehyde, as the smallest oxygenate with alcohol and aldehyde functionality, was studied via a DFT-based microkinetic model. It was found that two decomposition pathways exist. Under conditions of low hydrogen surface coverage, the initial C-H bond breaking reaction to HOCH(2)CO* is prevalent, while under conditions of high hydrogen coverage, the rather unexpected O-H bond forming reaction to HOCH(2)CHOH* is more active (subsequent decomposition is energetically favorable from HOCH(2)CHOH*). Our results indicate the possibility that (de)hydrogenation chemistry is rate-controlling in many small polyoxygenate biomass derivatives, and suitable catalysts are needed. Finally, DFT was used to understand the increased decomposition activity observed on the surface segregated Ni-Pt-Pt bimetallic catalyst. It was found that the initial O-H bond breaking of glycolaldehyde to OCH(2)CHO* has an activation barrier of just 0.21 eV. This barrier is lower than that of any glycolaldehyde consuming reaction on Pt. These computational predictions are in qualitative agreement with experimental results.},

  Abstract                 = {Rank transformations are frequently employed in numerical experiments involving a computational model, especially in the context of sensitivity and uncertainty analyses. Response surface replacement and parameter screening are tasks which may benefit from a rank transformation. Ranks can cope with nonlinear (albeit monotonic) input-output distributions, allowing the use of linear regression techniques. Rank transformed statistics are more robust, and provide a useful solution in the presence of long tailed input and output distributions. As is known to practitioners, care must be employed when interpreting the results of such analyses, as any conclusion drawn using ranks does not translate easily to the original model. In the present note an heuristic approach is taken, to explore, by way of practical examples, the effect of a rank transformation on the outcome of a sensitivity analysis. An attempt is made to identify trends, and to correlate these effects to a model taxonomy. Employing sensitivity indices, whereby the total variance of the model output is decomposed into a sum of terms of increasing dimensionality, we show that the main effect of the rank transformation is to increase the relative weight of the first order terms (the `main effects'), at the expense of the `interactions' and `higher order interactions'. As a result the influence of those parameters which influence the output mostly by way of interactions may be overlooked in an analysis based on the ranks. This difficulty increases with the dimensionality of the problem, and may lead to the failure of a rank based sensitivity analysis. We suggest that the models can be ranked, with respect to the complexity of their input-output relationship, by mean of an `Association' index Iy. Iy may complement the usual model coefficient of determination Ry2 as a measure of model complexity for the purpose of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {A review. Heating occurs in Titan's stratosphere from the absorption of incident solar radiation by methane and aerosols. About 10% of the incident sunlight reaches Titan's surface and causes heating there. Thermal radiation redistributes heat within the atm. and cools to space. The resulting vertical temp. profile is stable against convection and a state of radiative equil. is established. Equating theor. and obsd. temp. profiles enables an empirical detn. of the vertical distribution of thermal opacity. A uniformly mixed aerosol is responsible for most of the opacity in the stratosphere, whereas collision-induced absorption of gases is the main contributor in the troposphere. Occasional clouds are obsd. in the troposphere in spite of the large degrees of methane supersatn. found there. Photochem. converts CH4 and N2 into more complex hydrocarbons and nitriles in the stratosphere and above. Thin ice clouds of trace orgs. are formed in the winter and early spring polar regions of the lower stratosphere. Pptg. ice particles serve as condensation sites for supersatd. methane vapor in the troposphere below, resulting in lowered methane degrees of supersatn. in the polar regions. Latitudinal variations of stratospheric temp. are seasonal, and lag instantaneous response to solar irradn. by about one season for two reasons: (1) an actual instantaneous thermal response to a latitudinal distribution of absorbing gases, themselves out of phase with the sun by about one season, and (2) a sluggish dynamical response of the stratosphere to the latitudinal transport of angular momentum, induced by radiative heating and cooling. Mean vertical abundances of stratospheric orgs. and aerosols are detd. primarily by atm. chem. and condensation, whereas latitudinal distributions are more influenced by meridional circulations. In addn. to preferential scavenging by pptg. ice particles from above, the polar depletion of supersatd. methane results from periodic scavenging by short-lived tropospheric clouds, coupled with the steady poleward Mar. of the continuously drying atm. due to meridional transport.

We report the first systematic analyses of these compds. using Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. The findings suggest surprising simplicity and nonrandomness in the mass distribution and regularity in species clusters. The degree of unsatn. generally increased with increasing mol. wt. in a predictable fashion, and nitrogen is proposed as the dominant carrier of unsatn. In detected compds. with a general formula of CxHyNz, the carbon to nitrogen ratio (x/z) varied only slightly within a narrow limit, and decreased with increasing mol. wts. These compds. are of potential prebiotic interest since they deposit on the surface of Titan, and would dissolve readily in transient aq. pools that might be generated from time to time by impacts and volcanic processes.

From the results of the kinetic isotope effect for the N(2D) reaction, a main reaction mechanism was assigned to be the N addition to the double bond. This conclusion is in accordance with the prediction of our previous ab initio calculations. Variational transition-state theory calculations were performed for the N(2D) reaction by using the results of ab initio molecular orbital calculations. It was suggested that correction of the "multiple surface coefficient" is necessary to interpret the measured rate constants. The ratio of the rate constant of N(2D) to that of N(2P) was found to be close to unity and was much smaller than those for the reactions with H2 and CH4. The deactivation process of N(2P) was determined to be the spin-allowed quenching process, N(2P) + C2H4(S0) N(4S) + C2H4(T1).},

With the passage of Pioneer 10 around Jupiter, there is another source of energy worthy of consideration, energetic protons (and electrons). Preliminary expts. to investigate the formation of colored polymers and other interesting mols. by the irradn. of gas mixts. by protons are discussed. Two to 4 Mev protons were used, with corresponding beam fluxes (as measured at 6RJ from the planet) equiv. to approx. 80 earth years at Jupiter per hr of exposure. As in the other types of expts., colored polymers were produced. An important feature of this work is the presence or absence of absorption at 5 mm in the different materials produced; Titan is quite dark at this wavelength and Io is fairly bright. Such features may provide criteria for accepting or rejecting various materials produced in these expts. as reasonable coloring agents for the outer solar system. [on SciFinder (R)]},

The results of some lab. expts. of the proton irradn. of mixts. of gases including CH4 H2, NH3, etc., have shown that liq. and solid materials are produced that are strong UV absorbers. However, the material produced from the CH4 + H2 mixt. was colorless, indicating that species contg. elements other thana C and H are necessary for the prodn. of color. Two such elements are N (as NH3 or N2) and S (as H2S) and colored materials were produced from such mixts. None of these materials has spectral properties identical to those shown by the planets.

H is not as rapid as predicted by elastic collision theory; (3) the net quantum loss of NH3 in the presence of a 200 fold excess of H2 is 0.02, much higher than was expected from the amt. of H2 present: (4) the conversion of NH3 into N2 in plasmas assocd. with infalling meteors is very efficient and rapid, and could account for most of the N2 present on Titan; (5) the yields of C2H2 and for most of the N2 present on Titan; (5) the yields of C2H2 and HCN from lightning induced chem. in mixts. of CH4 and N2 is consistent with quenched thermodn. models of the discharge core; and (6) photolysis induced by the UV light emitted by the gases in the hot plasmas may account for some, if not most, of the excess prodn. of C2H6 and the more complex hydrocarbons.

  Abstract                 = {During the next decade or so, NASA, in conjunction with the European Space Agency, plans to send a spacecraft to the Saturnian system so that local studies of Saturn and its satellite, Titan, can be made. In order to study the atm. of Titan, analyses of both aerosols and gases will have to be made. To accomplish this, gas chromatog. instrumentation for the collection and anal. of org. gases and aerosols in Titan's atm. is being developed. The aerosols will be collected and then subjected to pyrolysis gas chromatog. (GC). Results using a simple GC system and tholin, made by subjecting a nominal Titan mixt. (96.8% N2, 3% CH4, 0.2% H2) to laser-supported shocks, show that many compds., including hydrocarbons and simple nitriles, can be identified by this technique. Atm. gases will be collected using large vol. (>10 cm3) sample loops and then analyzed by gas chromatog. Large vol. samples are required because the ambient pressures, where the probe instruments are first deployed, will be low (<10 mbar). Preliminary studies using a 20 cm3 sampling system and a very sensitive metastable ionization detector show that hydrocarbon components at the 10 ppb level can be detected. Work will continue to improve GC sensitivity, minimize anal. time, and develop interfaces with suitable sample collectors for anal. of atmospheres by future spacecraft. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  Abstract                 = {Molecule formation, surface modification and deposition in plasmas can in first order be described as dissociation in the plasma and association of fragments at the surface. In active plasmas ionization and dissociation by electrons is accompanied by excitation. But besides these direct electron processes also a second dissociation channel is active: that by charge transfer followed by dissociative recombination. This latter route is the dominant one in the colder recombining phase of the plasma. Atomic and molecular radicals diffuse or flow to the surface, where new molecules are formed. As a result the original molecules are, after being dissociated in the plasma, converted at the surface to new simple molecules, as H2, CO, N2, H2O, O2, NO, NH3, HCN, C2H2, CH4, to name a few in C/H/O/N containing plasmas. There is evidence that the molecular fragments resulting from dissociative recombination are ro-vibrationally (and possible electronically) excited. Also the molecules resulting from association at the surface may be ro-vibrationally or electronically excited. This may facilitate follow up processes as negative ion formation by dissociative attachment. These negative ions will be lost by mutual recombination with positive ions, giving again excited fragments. Rotational or other excitation may change considerably plasma chemistry.},

  Abstract                 = {Here we present the first quantitative study of the gas to solid particle conversion in a Radio Frequency dusty plasma experiment simulating the complex atmospheric reactivity on Titan. Analogues of Titan's aerosols have been produced in different N2-CH4 gas mixtures. Using in situ mass spectrometry, it has been found that, by varying the initial methane concentration, aerosols could be produced in methane steady state concentrations similar to Titan's atmospheric conditions. In our experiment, an initial ~5% methane concentration is necessary to ensure a ~1.5% methane steady state concentration in the plasma. The tholin mass production rate has been quantified as a function of the initial methane concentration. A maximum was found for a steady state CH4 concentration in agreement with Titan's atmospheric CH4 concentrations. At this maximum, the tholin C/N ratio is about 1.45 and the carbon gas to solid conversion yield is about 35%. We have modelled the mass production rate by a parabolic function, highlighting two competitive chemical regimes controlling the tholin production efficiency: an efficient growth process which is proportional to the methane consumption, and an inhibiting process which opposes the growth process and dominates it for initial methane concentrations higher than ~5%. To explain these two opposite effects, we propose two mechanisms: one involving HCN patterns in the tholins for the growth process, and one involving the increasing amount of atomic hydrogen in the plasma as well as the increase in aliphatic contributions in the tholins for the inhibiting process. This study highlights new routes for understanding the chemical growth of the organic aerosols in Titan's atmosphere.},

Semiempirical methods (AM1 and PM3), conventional uncorrelated and correlated ab initio molecular orbital procedures [Hartree-Fock (HF), Mller-Plesset (MP2), and quadratic configuration interaction including single and double substitutions (QCISD)], and several variants of density functional theory (DFT: B-LYP, B-P86, B3-LYP, B3-P86, and B3-PW91) have been examined in conjunction with the 3-21G, 6-31G(d), 6-31+G(d), 6-31G(d,p), 6-311G(d,p), and 6-311G(df,p) basis sets. The scaling factors for the theoretical harmonic vibrational frequencies were determined by a comparison with the corresponding experimental fundamentals utilizing a total of 1066 individual vibrations. Scaling factors suitable for low-frequency vibrations were obtained from least-squares fits of inverse frequencies. ZPVE scaling factors were obtained from a comparison of the computed ZPVEs (derived from theoretically determined harmonic vibrational frequencies) with ZPVEs determined from experimental harmonic frequencies and anharmonicity corrections for a set of 39 molecules. Finally, scaling factors for theoretical frequencies that are applicable for the computation of thermal contributions to enthalpy and entropy have been derived. A complete set of recommended scale factors is presented. The most successful procedures overall are B3-PW91/6-31G(d), B3-LYP/6-31G(d), and HF/6-31G(d).},

  Abstract                 = {Cyanoacetylene (CA) is an important minor constituent in the Titan atm. and is present in the interstellar medium. The absorption cross section of CA has been measured in the region from 190 to 255 nm with a resoln. of 1 nm. The photochem. of CA at 193.3 nm has been studied using a quadrupole mass spectrometer and a Fourier transform IR spectrometer for product anal. From the photolysis of HC3N-D2 and HC3N-CD4 mixts. and a plateau value of 0.3 for the quantum yield (QY) of DC3N (C3N + D2 -> DC3N + D), it is concluded that the main dissocn. process is HC3N + hn -> H + C3N with a QY of 0.30 +- 0.05 and a minor process is HC3N + hn -> C2H + CN with a QY equal to or less than 0.02. The remaining process is the formation of metastable CA (a triplet or carbene). The photolysis of CA induces a noticeable pressure decrease and a concomitant formation of a mist. The QY of CA disappearance is 4.5 +- 0.5, which is much higher than that of diacetylene (QY = 2.0 +- 0.5) and of acetylene (QY = 2.3). The rapid mist formation in CA may explain a haze obsd. in the Titan atm. A detailed mist formation process is not known. The C3N radical disappears partially by C3N + HC3N -> C6N2 + H and 2C3N -> C6N2. To explain the formation of minor products, HCN, C2H2, HC5N, and C4N2, two processes involving an unspecified CA metastable state or states may be proposed: HC3N* + HC3N -> HC5N + HCN and C4N2 + C2H2.

  Abstract                 = {In Titan's atmosphere consisting of N2 and CH4, large amounts of atomic hydrogen are produced by photochemical reactions during the formation of complex organics. This atomic hydrogen may undergo heterogeneous reactions with organic aerosol in the stratosphere and mesosphere of Titan. In order to investigate both the mechanisms and kinetics of the heterogeneous reactions, atomic deuterium is irradiated onto Titan tholin formed from N2 and CH4 gas mixtures at various surface-temperatures of the tholin ranging from 160 to 310 K. The combined analyses of the gas species and the exposed tholin indicate that the interaction mechanisms of atomic deuterium with the tholin are composed of three reactions; (a) abstraction of hydrogen from tholin resulting in gaseous HD formation (HD recombination), (b) addition of D atom into tholin (hydrogenation), and (c) removal of carbon and/or nitrogen (chemical erosion). The reaction probabilities of HD recombination and hydrogenation are obtained as [eta]abst=1.9(±0.6)×10-3×exp(-300/T) and [eta]hydro=2.08(±0.64)×exp(-1000/T), respectively. The chemical erosion process is very inefficient under the conditions of temperature range of Titan's stratosphere and mesosphere. Under Titan conditions, the rates of hydrogenation > HD recombination >> chemical erosion. Our measured HD recombination rate is about 10 times (with an uncertainty of a factor of 3-5) the prediction of previous theoretical model. These results imply that organic aerosol can remove atomic hydrogen efficiently from Titan's atmosphere through the heterogeneous reactions and that the presence of aerosol may affect the subsequent organic chemistry.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the key components controlling the chemical composition and climatology of Titan's atmosphere is the removal of reactive atomic hydrogen from the atmosphere. A proposed process of the removal of atomic hydrogen is the heterogeneous reaction with organic aerosol. In this study, we investigate the effect of heterogeneous reactions in Titan's atmospheric chemistry using new measurements of the heterogeneous reaction rate [Sekine, Y., Imanaka, H., Matsui, T., Khare, B.N., Bakes, E.L.O., McKay, C.P., Sugita, S., 2008. Icarus 194, 186-200] in a one-dimensional photochemical model. Our results indicate that 60-75% of the atomic hydrogen in the stratosphere and mesosphere are consumed by the heterogeneous reactions. This result implies that the heterogeneous reactions on the aerosol surface may predominantly remove atomic hydrogen in Titan's stratosphere and mesosphere. The results of our calculation also indicate that a low concentration of atomic hydrogen enhances the concentrations of unsaturated complex organics, such as C4H2 and phenyl radical, by more than two orders in magnitude around 400 km in altitude. Such an increase in unsaturated species may induce efficient haze production in Titan's mesosphere and upper stratosphere. These results imply a positive feedback mechanism in haze production in Titan's atmosphere. The increase in haze production would affect the chemical composition of the atmosphere, which might induce further haze production. Such a positive feedback could tend to dampen the loss and supply cycles of CH4 due to an episodic CH4 release into Titan's atmosphere.},

  Abstract                 = {Cross sections for the dissociative recombination of isomeric HCN+/HNC+ ions with electrons were measured using the single-pass merged beam experiment located at the University of Western Ontario in Canada. The source conditions were varied so that an HCN+/HNC+ mixture was first studied. The HNC+ ion was then isolated via the fast ion-molecule reaction HCN++CO2toHNC++CO2. The two sets of measurements, which both refer to vibrationally (and electronically) excited states of HCN+ and HNC+, exhibit differences in the magnitudes of the cross sections. Thermal rate coefficients have been calculated for both species. An attempt has been made to identify the valence states involved in the dissociation to the CN+H channel for HCN+ recombination.},

  Abstract                 = {We review recent advances in the study of the dissociative recombination of molecular ions with electrons with a primary emphasis on experimental studies. In particular, we focus on previous experimental measurements of recombination rates for N$_2^+$, O$_2^+$, and NO$^+$ ions. In the context of this review, we present temperature dependent rate coefficients from recent merged beam studies of the dissociative recombination of N$_2^+$, O$_2^+$, and NO$^+$ ions with electrons. Identifying underlying physical differences between the various experimental techniques enables a discussion of the effects of vibrational excitation on the dissociative recombination of these major ionospheric species of ions. For T < 1200 K, we conclude that the recombination rates for N$_2^+$, O$_2^+$, and NO$^+$ ions in the ground electronic and vibrational states respectively are 2.2 $\times$ $10^{-7}$ (Te/300)$^{-0.39}$ cm$^3$.s$^{-1}, 1.95 $\times$ $10^{-7}$ (Te/300)${-0.70}$ cm$^3$.s$^{-1}$, and (3.5 $\pm$ 0.5) $\times$ $10^{-7}$ (Te/300)/^{-0.69}$ cm$^3$s$^{-1}$. Vibrational excitation is shown to play a significant role in laboratory measurements of these recombination rates. For each of these species, vibrationally excited ions yielded a lower recombination rate than the ground state. We also discuss the recombination of these species of ions for T > 1200 K.},

  Abstract                 = {Log-normal linear models are widely used in applications, and many times it is of interest to predict the response variable or to estimate the mean of the response variable at the original scale for a new set of covariate values. In this paper we consider the problem of efficient estimation of the conditional mean of the response variable at the original scale for log-normal linear models. Several existing estimators are reviewed first, including the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator, the restricted ML (REML) estimator, the uniformly minimum variance unbiased (UMVU) estimator, and a bias-corrected REML estimator. We then propose two estimators that minimize the asymptotic mean squared error and the asymptotic bias, respectively. A parametric bootstrap procedure is also described to obtain confidence intervals for the proposed estimators. Both the new estimators and the bootstrap procedure are very easy to implement. Comparisons of the estimators using simulation studies suggest that our estimators perform better than the existing ones, and the bootstrap procedure yields confidence intervals with good coverage properties. A real application of estimating the mean sediment discharge is used to illustrate the methodology.},

  Abstract                 = {Polyynes are of astrophys. interest since they appear to be involved in org. chem. in very different media. In Titan's atm., the lightest polyyne, C4H2, was detected by Voyager. Recently C4H2 and C6H2 were discovered in a protoplanetary nebula, suggesting polyynes as a possible chem. pathway to PAH (polycyclic arom. hydrocarbons). Also, several exptl. simulations and modeling imply their prodn. from the photochem. of methane and their involvement in the formation of org. aerosols. After the study of C4H2 and C6H2 spectra in the UV and IR wavelength range, the authors report here the 1st spectrum of gaseous C8H2 in the range 400-4000 cm-1 at room temp. and low resoln. The task was hardly achieved because of the high instability of this mol. with temp. and pressure. To avoid exothermic polymn., the compd. as mixed with a solvent. The authors have performed a sep. spectroscopic study of the solvent to det. C8H2 partial pressure within the mixt. This allowed the authors to calc. C8H2 integrated band intensities. In the studied wavelength range, C8H2 presents three main bands similar to those of C6H2 in terms of vibrational type, position, and relative intensity. To study the possible identification of these polyynes by spatial observatories (Cassini-Huygens, ISO), the authors have also measured the C6H2 and C8H2 IR spectra in the range 400-1500 cm-1 at 0.35 cm-1 resoln.

  Abstract                 = {Discovery by Cassini's plasma instrument of heavy positive and negative ions within Titan's upper atmosphere and ionosphere has advanced our understanding of ion neutral chemistry within Titan's upper atmosphere, primarily composed of molecular nitrogen, with ~2.5% methane. The external energy flux transforms Titan's upper atmosphere and ionosphere into a medium rich in complex hydrocarbons, nitriles and haze particles extending from the surface to 1200 km altitudes. The energy sources are solar UV, solar X-rays, Saturn's magnetospheric ions and electrons, solar wind and shocked magnetosheath ions and electrons, galactic cosmic rays (GCR) and the ablation of incident meteoritic dust from Enceladus' E-ring and interplanetary medium. Here it is proposed that the heavy atmospheric ions detected in situ by Cassini for heights >950 km, are the likely seed particles for aerosols detected by the Huygens probe for altitudes <100 km. These seed particles may be in the form of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) containing both carbon and hydrogen atoms CnHx. There could also be hollow shells of carbon atoms, such as C60, called fullerenes which contain no hydrogen. The fullerenes may compose a significant fraction of the seed particles with PAHs contributing the rest. As shown by Cassini, the upper atmosphere is bombarded by magnetospheric plasma composed of protons, H2+ and water group ions. The latter provide keV oxygen, hydroxyl and water ions to Titan's upper atmosphere and can become trapped within the fullerene molecules and ions. Pickup keV N2+, N+ and CH4+ can also be implanted inside of fullerenes. Attachment of oxygen ions to PAH molecules is uncertain, but following thermalization O+ can interact with abundant CH4 contributing to the CO and CO2 observed in Titan's atmosphere. If an exogenic keV O+ ion is implanted into the haze particles, it could become free oxygen within those aerosols that eventually fall onto Titan's surface. The process of freeing oxygen within aerosols could be driven by cosmic ray interactions with aerosols at all heights. This process could drive pre-biotic chemistry within the descending aerosols. Cosmic ray interactions with grains at the surface, including water frost depositing on grains from cryovolcanism, would further add to abundance of trapped free oxygen. Pre-biotic chemistry could arise within surface microcosms of the composite organic-ice grains, in part driven by free oxygen in the presence of organics and any heat sources, thereby raising the astrobiological potential for microscopic equivalents of Darwin's "warm ponds" on Titan.},

The heats of formation for the tert-butyl cation (716 +- 10 kJ mol-1) and isobutene (14 +- 8 kJ mol-1) predicted by the same theoretical methods are also slightly higher than the experimental values (711.5 +- 0.2 and 16.9 +- 0.9 kJ mol-1, respectively), while the proton affinity of isobutene (802 +- 4 kJ mol-1) is in very good agreement with experiment (801.7 +- 1.4 kJ mol-1). On the other hand, the calculated ionization energy of the tert-butyl radical (6.81 +- 0.06 eV) is significantly higher than two experimental values (6.58 and 6.70 eV), suggesting that a reexamination may be desirable.},

  Abstract                 = {Prompted by some recenst measurements of the recombination coefficient for H+3, i.e. [alpha](H+3), which indicate a value of [approximate]2×10-7 cm3 s-1 at 300 K for ground vibrational state ions, i.e. about a factor of ten greater than our previous FALP determination [less-than-or-equals, slant]2×10-8 cm3 s-1, we have made a further detailed study of this very important interstellar recombination reaction using our improved FALP apparatus. Thus we have shown that [alpha](H3+(v[greater-or-equal, slanted]3)) ions do indeed recombine quite efficiently, a mean recombination coefficient at 300 K being [approximate]1.3×10-7 cm3 s-1, but that vibrationally-relaxed ions recombine much more slowly, [alpha](H3+(v=1,0)) being [approximate]3×10-8 cm3 s-1 and [alpha](H3+ (v=0)) being somewhat smaller at (1-2)×10-8 cm3 s-1 at 300 K. Measurements at 210 and 140 K indicated a slow increase of [alpha](H3+) with decreasing temperature, the increase being less than a factor of 2 for both [alpha](H3+(v[greater-or-equal, slanted]3)) and [alpha](H3+(v=1,0)) between 300 and 140 K. Values of [alpha](D3+) were also obtained at 300 K only. The values obtained for both the rapidly-recombining and the slowly-recombining D3+ ions were somewhat smaller than the corresponding values for H3+. In addition to these studies, we have also re-measured the [alpha] values at both 300 and 100 K for HCO+, N2H+ and CH5+ which are also important interstellar ions. The values obtained are in reasonable agreement with our previous FALP measurements, but our [alpha](HCO+) and [alpha](N2H+) are lower by factors of 2 and 3 respectively than the recent measurements made in a pulsed afterglow experiment.},

Advances in the temperature-range and accuracy of kinetic measurements, principally inspired by the need to provide data for models of combustion, atmospheric, and astrophysical chemistry, show up the inadequacy of the venerable Arrhenius equation-at least, over wide ranges of temperature. This critical review will address the question of how to reach an understanding of the factors that control the rates of 'non-Arrhenius' reactions. It makes use of a number of recent kinetic measurements and shows how developments in advanced forms of transition state theory provide satisfactory explanations of complex kinetic behaviour (72 references).},

This Review focuses on the reactions of molecular and atomic radicals with neutral molecules. Rate constants for almost 50 such reactions have been measured at temperatures as low as 13 K by using the CRESU method. The surprising demonstration that so many reactions between electrically neutral species can be extremely rapid at these very low temperatures has excited interest both from theoreticians and from those seeking to understand the chemistry that gives rise to the 135 or so molecules that are present in low-temperature molecular clouds in the interstellar medium. Theoretical treatments of these reactions are based on the idea that a reaction occurs when the long-range potential between the reagent species brings them into close contact. The astrochemical context, theoretical studies, and the determination of the rate constants of these low-temperature reactions are critically discussed.},

The theor. evolution of such a system has been investigated using three chem. models, and the predictions compared with our exptl. data. Our expts. confirm that dissocn. of methane can be catalyzed by the photolysis of acetylene at 185 nm. The quant. comparison with theor. results reveals an exptl. effect, which we explain as a heterogeneous process occurring on the walls of the reactor. We propose a mechanism for this wall effect that is in qual. agreement with our observations. We are currently developing an approach that will allow quantification of this effect, with the aim of extrapolating lab. results to an open system.

  Abstract                 = {The authors used existing exptl. measurements of the chem. evolution of samples of CH4, subjected to photolysis at 123.6 and 147 nm. These measurements were compared with the theor. predictions of a photochem. box model using three different reaction schemes with the ultimate aim of developing a scheme valid for all values of temp., pressure and photolysis wavelength. The lab. results seem to have been influenced by an exptl. wall effect leading to loss of H atoms. The authors propose a scheme of reactions that seems the most robust under conditions of low temps. and pressures, required for the modeling of planetary atmospheres, such as that of Titan, and of the interstellar medium. It appears that there is still some uncertainty in the mechanism of prodn. of C2H2 under the conditions of the two lab. expts. studied. There is also a need to investigate the sensitivity of the results of such photochem. schemes to the values of rate consts., absorption cross sections and quantum yields used. [on SciFinder (R)]},

Emission altitude profiles are compared to the results from an electron transport and chemical reaction model. The model incorporates measurements of the energetic electron flux, neutral composition, ion composition, and electron density. Reasonable correspondence is obtained using primarily the âclassicalâ sources of O(Â¹D) excitation: electron impact on atomic oxygen and dissociative recombination of O2 +. The reaction of N(Â²D) with O2 is considered to be a minor source. Small contributions are also calculated for cascade from O(Â¹S), electron impact dissociation of O2, reaction of N+ with O2, and energy transfer from O+(Â²D) and thermal electrons to O(Â³P). A possible minor source from the quenching of N(Â²D) or N(Â²P) by O(Â³P) is also discussed.},

Te within the range 300 K [less-than-or-equals, slant]Te[less-than-or-equals, slant]2000 K. These measurements have been achieved using the upgraded flowing afterglow--Langmuir probe (FALP) technique by which it is now possible to rapidly determine the Te (and also the electron energy distribution function) and the electron number density ne at any point along the axis of the flowing afterglow plasma. The elevated Te (above the carrier gas temperature Tg) are readily achievable in argon carrier gas but not in helium carrier gas in which Te remains equal to Tg. The [alpha] for both O2+ and NO+ are seen to vary with Te in power-law fashions, i.e. [alpha](O2+) [approximate]Te-0.65 and [alpha](NO+)[approximate]Te-0.85 over the range of Te investigated, being the same as the power-law variations observed for isothermal conditions (i.e. Tg=Te=Ti, the ion temperature) in our previous FALP study within the range 200K[less-than-or-equals, slant]Tg[less-than-or-equals, slant]600 K. The implication of these results is that Te (not Ti) primarily determines [alpha](O2+) and [alpha](NO+) in this temperature regime, in accordance with theoretical expectations. The ranges of Tg and Te over which these [alpha] have now been determined are precisely those required for ionospheric deionization studies. The results obtained are compared with previous measurements, including some ionospheric in-situ measurements of [alpha](NO+) as a function of Te, and, in general, the agreement between the previous and the present measurements is good.},

All reactions are characterized by a C2H versus H atom exchange and in the case of the C2H/C2H2 system by an additional molecular hydrogen (H2) elimination pathway. The attack of the ethynyl radical onto the [pi]-electron density of the unsaturated hydrocarbons has no entrance barrier and initializes each reaction. Consecutive hydrogen atom migrations may precede the exit channels. Diacetylene (HCCCCH), the butadiynyl radical (HCCCC), methyldiacetylene (CH3CCCCH), ethynylallene (H2CCH(C2H)), and penta-4-diyne (HCC(CH2)C2H) were identified as products of which only diacetylene has yet been observed in Titan's atmosphere. Our results, however, strongly suggest the presence of all these species on Titan, and the Cassini-Huygens mission is likely to detect these upon arrival in the Saturnian system in 2004.},

  Abstract                 = {The possibility that aerosols generated through CH4 photolysis could be responsible for the haze layer on Pluto (Elliot, J. L. et al., 1989) is examd. A comprehensive model of aerosol prodn., particle growth, sedimentation and condensation is applied to the atm. of Pluto using pressures, temps., and compn. derived from the stellar occultation and other data. Two atm. models proposed in the literature, one from Elliot et al. [1989], and one from W. B. Hubbard et al. [1989], as well as a range of optical properties for the particles were tested. To produce a haze with unity tangential optical depth at 1174 km, an aerosol mass prodn. rate equal to twice the total CH4 dissocn. rate due to solar UV expected for Pluto was used with an assumption that the particles produced were 10 times more absorbing than those in other hazes in the outer solar system. The possibility of condensation in the lower atm. was considered but did not result in distinctly different haze optical depths. If a photochem. haze on Pluto was responsible for the occultation light curve measured by Elliot et al., operation of a photochem. system different from those on Titan, Uranus, or Neptune is indicated. Alternatives include near-surface condensation processes driven by circulation, and the possibility that the occultation light curve can be explained in its entirety by temp. effects as proposed by W.B. Hubbard et al. [1989]. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  Abstract                 = {Bayesian model selection (BMS) is a powerful method for determining the most likely among a set of competing hypotheses about the mechanisms that generated observed data. BMS has recently found widespread application in neuroimaging, particularly in the context of dynamic causal modelling (DCM). However, so far, combining BMS results from several subjects has relied on simple (fixed effects) metrics, e.g. the group Bayes factor (GBF), that do not account for group heterogeneity or outliers. In this paper, we compare the GBF with two random effects methods for BMS at the between-subject or group level. These methods provide inference on model-space using a classical and Bayesian perspective respectively. First, a classical (frequentist) approach uses the log model evidence as a subject-specific summary statistic. This enables one to use analysis of variance to test for differences in log-evidences over models, relative to inter-subject differences. We then consider the same problem in Bayesian terms and describe a novel hierarchical model, which is optimised to furnish a probability density on the models themselves. This new variational Bayes method rests on treating the model as a random variable and estimating the parameters of a Dirichlet distribution which describes the probabilities for all models considered. These probabilities then define a multinomial distribution over model space, allowing one to compute how likely it is that a specific model generated the data of a randomly chosen subject as well as the exceedance probability of one model being more likely than any other model. Using empirical and synthetic data, we show that optimising a conditional density of the model probabilities, given the log-evidences for each model over subjects, is more informative and appropriate than both the GBF and frequentist tests of the log-evidences. In particular, we found that the hierarchical Bayesian approach is considerably more robust than either of the other approaches in the presence of outliers. We expect that this new random effects method will prove useful for a wide range of group studies, not only in the context of DCM, but also for other modelling endeavours, e.g. comparing different source reconstruction methods for EEG/MEG or selecting among competing computational models of learning and decision-making.},

Volatile-rich models are described in which the present Titan consists of a methane clathrate shell overlying a deep water-ammonia ocean and solid ammonia hydrate. The central core of rock (radius .simeq. 1900 km) comprises about one half the total mass. The surficial hydrocarbon \"ocean\" is stored in an \"aquifer\" (sub-surface caverns and pore space) thereby reconciling previous arguments for an ocean with radar and tidal constraints.

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we show that a wide variety of common soil bacteria are able to obtain their carbon and energy needs from tholin (a class of complex organic heteropolymers thought to be widely distributed through the solar system; in this case tholin was produced by passage of electrical discharge through a mixture of methane, ammonia, and water vapor). We have isolated aerobic, anaerobic, and facultatively anaerobic bacteria which are able to use tholin as a sole carbon source. Organisms which metabolize tholin represent a variety of bacterial genera including Clostridium, Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Acinetobacter, Paracoccus, Alcaligenes, Micrococcus, Corynebacterium, Aerobacter, Arthrobacter, Flavobacterium, and Actinomyces. Aerobic tholin-using bacteria were first isolated from soils containing unusual or sparse carbon sources. Some of these organisms were found to be facultatively anaerobic. Strictly anaerobic tholin-using bacteria were isolated from both carbon-rich and carbon-poor anaerobic lake muds. In addition, both aerobic and anaerobic tholin-using bacteria were isolated from common soil collected outside the laboratory building. Some, but not all, of the strains that were able to obtain carbon from tholin were also able to obtain their nitrogen requirements from tholin. Bacteria isolated from common soils were tested for their ability to obtain carbon from the water-soluble fraction, the ethanol-soluble fraction, and the water/ethanol-insoluble fraction of the tholin. Of the 3.5 x 10(7) bacteria isolated per gram of common soils, 1.7, 0.5, and 0.2%, respectively, were able to obtain their carbon requirements from the water-soluble fraction, the ethanol-soluble fraction and the water/ethanol-insoluble fraction of the tholin. The palatability of tholins to modern microbes may have implications for the early evolution of microbial life on Earth. Tholins may have formed the base of the food chain for an early heterotrophic biosphere before the evolution of autotrophy on the early Earth. Where tholins are present on other planets, they could possibly be metabolized by contaminant microorganisms transported to these bodies via spacecraft. Thus, the presence of tholins should be taken into account when evaluating the planetary quarantine requirements for probes to other planets. [on SciFinder (R)]},

Based on UV-Vis-IR spectroscopy, the formation of new mols., the alteration of band profiles, and the spectral behavior of the original compds. were studied. The ratio CO/CO2 has been measured, as a function of ion fluence, in several frozen gases (or mixts.). These results are discussed in the light of their relevance in some planetary environments. In particular, the authors suggest that ion irradn., which is esp. intense at Io, can modify the spectral properties of frozen SO2 thus contributing to explain the spectral behavior of this Jovian moon. The prodn., by cosmic ion irradn., of CO and CO2 at the surfaces and/or in the atmospheres of Titan, Triton, Pluto, and Charon is discussed. Some predictions of the expected CO/CO2 ratio at the surfaces and/or in the atmospheres of those objects are provided. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  Abstract                 = {The upper atmosphere of Titan is currently losing mass at a rate , by hydrodynamic escape as a high density, slow outward expansion driven principally by solar UV heating by CH4 absorption. The hydrodynamic mass loss is essentially CH4 and H2 escape. Their combined escape rates are restricted by power limitations from attaining their limiting rates (and limiting fluxes). Hence they must exhibit gravitational diffusive separation in the upper atmosphere with increasing mixing ratios to eventually become major constituents in the exosphere. A theoretical model with solar EUV heating by N2 absorption balanced by HCN rotational line cooling in the upper thermosphere yields densities and temperatures consistent with the Huygens Atmospheric Science Investigation (HASI) data [Fulchignoni, M., and 42 colleagues, 2005. Nature 438, 785-791], with a peak temperature of ~185-190 K between 3500-3550 km. This model implies hydrodynamic escape rates of and , or some other combination with a higher H2 escape flux, much closer to its limiting value, at the expense of a slightly lower CH4 escape rate. Nonthermal escape processes are not required to account for the loss rates of CH4 and H2, inferred by the Cassini Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) measurements [Yelle, R.V., Borggren, N., de la Haye, V., Kasprzak, W.T., Niemann, H.B., Muller-Wodarg, I., Waite Jr., J.H., 2006.

The optical depth profiles are not of sufficient accuracy to extrapolate and accurately infer the tropopause CH4 mixing ratio, but it approaches high values .apprx.0.026-0.034.

If the defaults do not embody these principles, then the only way to produce good graphics is to be sufficiently familiar with the principles of statistical graphics. This paper shows that Excel graphics defaults do not embody the appropriate principles. Users who want to use Excel are advised to know the principles of good graphics well enough so that they can choose the appropriate options to override the defaults. Microsoft® should overhaul the Excel graphics engine so that its defaults embody the principles of statistical graphics and make it easy for non-experts to produce good graphs.},

  Abstract                 = {The Acoustic Properties Investigation (API) is a set of sensors for acoustic measurements in gases or liqs., making a part of the Surface Science Package (SSP) on the Huygens probe. It consists of 2 units, API-V (Velocity of sound) and API-S (Sounding). The API-V has 2 ultrasonic transducers sending and receiving acoustic pulses over an unobstructed path of 15 cm. An accurate timing circuit is measuring the time it takes to propagate over the distance. Measurements are made in both directions to eliminate the effect of a const. drift of the medium. The transducers were optimized to operate at low pressure (high altitude) and will operate from about 60 km down to the surface. They will also perform well in case of landing in a liq. The API-S unit is an acoustic sounder, sending short pulses at 15 kHz every second and listening for echoes in between. It will detect droplets in the atm. and for the last 100 m it will characterize the acoustic scattering properties of the surface below. It will also give an accurate value for the descend velocity during the last 100 m. In case of landing in a (liq.) lake/ocean it will measure the depth of the lake/ocean down to a max. of about 1000 m. Accurate measurements of the velocity of sound will, together with knowledge on the temp., enable the mean mol. wt. to be calcd. along the descent trajectory. The temp. will be measured by complementary sensors inside the SSP Top Hat, near the API-V, and to a high accuracy by the HASI instrument at the periphery of the Huygens probe. The API units and assocd. electronics was designed and build at the Research and Scientific Support Department at ESTEC, where also the testing and initial calibration was done. Detailed calibration was performed with different gas mixts. and at different temps. in the Titan simulation chamber at the University of Kent, Canterbury, UK. Further supporting studies are planned in the new Titan simulation chamber at the Open University, Milton Keynes, UK. This paper discusses the hardware, the modes of operation, the calibration and the expected performances, including error sources, measurement accuracy and range of operation. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  Abstract                 = {Benzene and C3 are both known to exist in the interstellar medium (ISM). Their reaction has been studied here in cryogenic matrices using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) absorption spectroscopy. The reaction produced a weakly bonded complex for which a C-C asymmetric stretch vibrational frequency in the C3 unit is shifted to lower energy (vs. uncomplexed C3) by 4.5 and 1.6 cm-1 in Ar and Kr matrices, respectively. The singlet potential surface of the C3 + C6H6 reaction was partially mapped using density functional theory (DFT) theory (B3LYP with 6-31G** and 6-311 + G**). Although thirteen stable products are predicted, only two agree satisfactorily with the observed small shift and the isotopomer frequencies of 13C-substituted C3 · C6H6 complexes. Products formed by the rearrangement of the complex's components apparently have no (or very low) entrance barriers. Finally, a low energy reaction pathway has been computed for the production of a dehydrogenated PAH (with an indene framework) from the reaction of the complexed C3 and C6H6 moieties. Indene has been observed previously in the discharge reactions of benzene where C3 has also been produced.},

  Abstract                 = {In the frame of the calibration of the aerosol collector and pyrolyser, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry experiments of the Huygens probe arrived at Titan, systematic experimental studies were led to estimate the influence of the operating conditions on the analyses that should have been achieved in the Titan's atmosphere. The primary objective of this study was to estimate the influence of operating conditions variations induced by (i) instrumental modifications made shortly before the probe launch which can have changed the operating pressures; (ii) the change of the probe environmental conditions (pressure, temperature) during its descent in the atmosphere; (iii) a possible deviation of pressure and temperature regulations from their nominal values because of the long journey of the instrument in space, or of other external events. The secondary objective of this work was to create an analytical database that can be used as a reference to treat the chromatograms obtained in situ, and help to identify chromatographically the analyzed species, complementary to mass spectrometry. Beyond the application to a specific instrument, this work was also useful to experimentally estimate the fundamental evolution of the separation as a function of the changes of operating conditions with time. The obtained results show (i) the significant influence of inlet and outlet pressure variation on the time of analysis, but not on the separation power. It thus enables to significantly shorten the analysis duration, and thus to analyze more compounds within the fixed time of analysis of the instrument; (ii) the significant influence of temperature on the retention. In this frame, the enthalpies of exchange between the gas phase and the stationary phase of the species were determined to be used to retrieve the analyzed species in case of deviation of the operating temperature; (iii) that the possible aging of the columns does not have influence on the columns efficiency and separation power; (iv) the analytical capabilities of the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry experiment within operating conditions representative of those encountered in situ. Finally, in spite of possible operating condition changes, it is shown that results coming from the gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer experiment, which are currently under analysis, could bring important information on the Titan's atmosphere and its history.},

  Abstract                 = {The combination of multiplexed mass spectrometry with photoionization by tunable-synchrotron radiation has proved to be a powerful tool to investigate elementary reaction kinetics and the chemistry of low-pressure flames. In both of these applications, multiple-mass detection and the ease of tunability of synchrotron radiation make it possible to acquire full sets of data as a function of mass, photon energy, and of the physical dimension of the system, e.g. distance from the burner or time after reaction initiation. The data are in essence an indirect image of the chemistry. The data can be quantitatively correlated and integrated along any of several dimensions to compare to traditional measurements such as time or distance profiles of individual chemical species, but it can also be directly interpreted in image form. This perspective offers an overview of flame chemistry and chemical kinetics measurements that combine tunable photoionization with multiple-mass detection, emphasizing the overall insight that can be gained from multidimensional data on these systems. The low-pressure flame apparatus is capable of providing isomer-resolved mass spectra of stable and radical species as a function of position in the flame. The overall chemical structure of the flames can be readily seen from images of the evolving mass spectrum as distance from the burner increases, with isomer-specific information given in images of the photoionization efficiency. Several flames are compared in this manner, with a focus on identification of global differences in fuel-decomposition and soot-formation pathways. Differences in the chemistry of flames of isomeric fuels can be discerned. The application of multiplexed synchrotron photoionization to elementary reaction kinetics permits identification of time-resolved isomeric composition in reacting systems. The power of this technique is illustrated by the separation of direct and dissociative ionization signals in the reaction of C2H5 with O2; by the resolution of isomeric products in reactions of the ethynyl (C2H) radical; and by preliminary observation of branching to methyl + propargyl products in the self-reaction of vinyl radicals. Finally, prospects for future research using multiplexed photoionization mass spectrometry are explored.},

  Abstract                 = {Computer models for the simulation of physical and environmental phenomena are often regulated by complicated dependences on unknown variables, and these unobservable inputs must be inferred from a comparison of simulator output against physical data. The standard Bayesian statistical approaches to this inference problem require fitting a complicated statistical model to the existing parameter evaluations, usually through use of a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling scheme. When there already exists a large bank of simulated values, it may be undesirable to develop a sophisticated statistical surrogate or to sample additional output from the computer simulator. In response to this motivation, we discuss a sampling importance resampling algorithm for Bayesian inference in inverse problems that works in conjunction with kernel density estimation to resample, from the original computer output, an approximate posterior sample for the unobservable variables of interest. Given a sufficiently large bank of computer output, our resampling method is able to provide high-quality results at a much lower cost than the standard Bayesian techniques. We present two applications where unobservable inputs are to be inferred from scarce observations and abundant simulated output. One consists of a climate simulator and the other of a groundwater flow model.},

Using quantum chemical methods, we have shown that the dissociative recombination of HNC+(X &#160;2S) should involve the indirect mechanism while that of HCN+(X &#160;2P) and HCN+(A &#160;2S) should be possible through both direct and indirect processes. Our theoretical study therefore suggests that HCN+(X &#160;2P) and HCN+(A &#160;2S) should recombine much more rapidly than HNC+(X &#160;2S) explaining the large rate coefficient measured for the DR of HCN+ compared with the HNC+ case.},

  Abstract                 = {Measurements of the (1-0) line of hydrogen cyanide at 88.6 GHz in the Titan atmosphere are reported. Synthetic spectra were fitted to the observations to derive the vertical distribution of HCN in the stratosphere. The observed line is significantly narrower than that computed for constant stratospheric mixing ratios, implying an increase in the HCN concentration with altitude. From a least-squares analysis taking into account measurement noise and calibration uncertainties, a mean mixing ratio scale height of 47-11+36 km is derived for the 100- to 300-km region. The HCN abundance is found to be best constrained around the 170-km level where the inferred mixing ratio is 3.3-0.8+0.9 x 10-7. The results are consistent with recent analyses of Voyager infrared measurements. The inferred vertical concentration gradient is much steeper and the abundance in the lower stratosphere smaller than predicted by current photochemical models. Theoretical HCN profiles may, however, be brought into agreement with the present results by reducing the magnitude of the vertical eddy mixing assumed in the stratosphere.},

  Abstract                 = {The ongoing pressurized water reactor (PWR) main steam line break (MSLB) benchmark problem, sponsored by the Office for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (US NRC), and the Pennsylvania State University (PSU) consists of three exercises, whose combined purpose is to verify the capability of system codes to analyze complex transients with coupled core/plant interactions; to test fully the 3D neutronics/thermal-hydraulic coupling; and to evaluate discrepancies between the predictions of coupled codes in best-estimate transient simulations. Exercise two is intended to test core response to imposed system thermal-hydraulic conditions. For this exercise, the participants are provided with transient boundary conditions and two cross-section libraries. Results are submitted for six steady-state cases and two transient scenarios. The boundary conditions, the details for each case, and the output requested are described in the final specifications for the benchmark problem. To fully analyze the data for comparison in the final report, a suite of statistical methods has been developed, to serve as a reference in the absence of experimental data. A corrected arithmetical mean and standard deviation are calculated for all data types: single-value parameters, 1D axial distributions, 2D radial distributions, and time histories. Each participant's deviation from the mean and a corresponding figure-of-merit are reported for the purposes of comparison and discussion. Selected mean values and standard deviations are presented in this paper for several parameters at specific points of interest: for the initial steady-state 2, at hot-full power, radial and axial power distributions are presented, along with effective multiplication factor, power peaking factors, and axial offset. For the snapshot taken at the time of highest return-to-power in transient Scenario 2, parameters presented include axial and radial power distributions, total and fission power levels, power peaking factors, and axial offset. Additionally, some features of the time histories for total power and fission power in Scenario 2 are presented and discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Mid- and far-infrared spectra from the Composite InfraRed Spectrometer (CIRS) have been used to determine volume mixing ratios of nitriles in Titan's atmosphere. HCN, HC3N, C2H2, and temperature were derived from 2.5 cm-1 spectral resolution mid-IR mapping sequences taken during three flybys, which provide almost complete global coverage of Titan for latitudes south of 60[degree sign] N. Three 0.5 cm-1 spectral resolution far-IR observations were used to retrieve C2N2 and act as a check on the mid-IR results for HCN. Contribution functions peak at around 0.5-5 mbar for temperature and 0.1-10 mbar for the chemical species, well into the stratosphere. The retrieved mixing ratios of HCN, HC3N, and C2N2 show a marked increase in abundance towards the north, whereas C2H2 remains relatively constant. Variations with longitude were much smaller and are consistent with high zonal wind speeds. For 90[degree sign]-20[degree sign] S the retrieved HCN abundance is fairly constant with a volume mixing ratio of around 1 x 10-7 at 3 mbar. More northerly latitudes indicate a steady increase, reaching around 4 x 10-7 at 60[degree sign] N, where the data coverage stops. This variation is consistent with previous measurements and suggests subsidence over the northern (winter) pole at approximately 2 x 10-4 m[thin space]s-1. HC3N displays a very sharp increase towards the north pole, where it has a mixing ratio of around 4 x 10-8 at 60[degree sign] N at the 0.1-mbar level. The difference in gradient for the HCN and HC3N latitude variations can be explained by HC3N's much shorter photochemical lifetime, which prevents it from mixing with air at lower latitude. It is also consistent with a polar vortex which inhibits mixing of volatile rich air inside the vortex with that at lower latitudes. Only one observation was far enough north to detect significant amounts of C2N2, giving a value of around 9 x 10-10 at 50[degree sign] N at the 3-mbar level.},

  Abstract                 = {The method of least squares is probably the most powerful data analysis tool available to scientists. Toward a fuller appreciation of that power, this work begins with an elementary review of statistics fundamentals, and then progressively increases in sophistication as the coverage is extended to the theory and practice of linear and nonlinear least squares. The results are illustrated in application to data analysis problems important in the life sciences. The review of fundamentals includes the role of sampling and its connection to probability distributions, the Central Limit Theorem, and the importance of finite variance. Linear least squares are presented using matrix notation, and the significance of the key probability distributions--Gaussian, chi[hyphen (true graphic)]square, and t--is illustrated with Monte Carlo calculations. The meaning of correlation is discussed, including its role in the propagation of error. When the data themselves are correlated, special methods are needed for the fitting, as they are also when fitting with constraints. Nonlinear fitting gives rise to nonnormal parameter distributions, but the 10% Rule of Thumb suggests that such problems will be insignificant when the parameter is sufficiently well determined. Illustrations include calibration with linear and nonlinear response functions, the dangers inherent in fitting inverted data (e.g., Lineweaver-Burk equation), an analysis of the reliability of the van't Hoff analysis, the problem of correlated data in the Guggenheim method, and the optimization of isothermal titration calorimetry procedures using the variance[hyphen (true graphic)]covariance matrix for experiment design. The work concludes with illustrations on assessing and presenting results.},

  Abstract                 = {The problem of correlation in data is considered for spectroscopic difference techniques. in the application of the method of combination differences to diatomic rotational structure with R and P branches only, there is no correlation problem, because each line is used only once in computing the differences. Under best circumstances the combination difference method can match the statistically optimum direct fit method exactly in the more limited goal of estimating the rotational and distortional constants for a given level. The correlation problem arises when a Q branch is added to a combination difference treatment, as it does also in the method of successive differences. Treatment of these cases by correlated least squares can again achieve exact agreement with the direct fit. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract: The equilibrium constant for the reaction, Br2(g) + Cl2(g) BrCl(g), is estimated using the classic spectrophotometric method with precise data and a multispectrum fitting approach. Analysis of spectra for 18 Cl2:Br2 mixing ratios yields K = 9.1 at 22 C, with a nominal statistical error (1 ) of 0.04. This error translates into a remarkable precision of 0.4 cm-1 in the dissociation energy of BrCl, easily beating that for the current best spectroscopic estimate (±5 cm-1). However, a sensitivity analysis shows that K is susceptible to small systematic errors and minor changes in the least-squares fit model, leading to a more conservative estimate of 2% error. The derived K is consistent with statistical mechanical estimates that employ the current value for the BrCl dissociation energy, but it differs considerably from some recently measured and used values, which range from 6.4 to 10.4. The revised estimate of the BrCl dissociation energy is D e = 18 248 ± 2 cm-1.},

Such methods can yield correlated data, the proper quantitative analysis of which requires correlated least squares. A formal treatment of these procedures shows that the source of the correlation is not the subtraction itself but the multiple use of data points from the raw data set in producing the differences. Typical applications of the Guggenheim method entail fitting the logarithm of the absolute differences to a straight line. Monte Carlo studies of both a constant-error and a proportional-error model for a declining exponential with a background show that neglect of weights is likely to be a greater source of imprecision than neglect of correlation. The most common form of the method of combination differences does not involve multiple use of the raw data and thus is a statistically sound procedure with no correlation problem.},

The test examples include polynomial and exponential representations and a band analysis model. For linear functions of linear LS parameters, the error propagation equation is exact. Nonlinear parameters and functions yield nonnormal distributions, but their dispersion is still well predicted by the propagation-of-error equation. Often the error computation can be bypassed by a redefinition of the least-squares model to include the quantity of interest as an adjustable parameter, in which case its variance is returned directly in the variance-covariance matrix. This approach is shown formally to be equivalent to the error propagation method.},

In particular, inversion and logarithmic conversion yield biased, non-Gaussian distributions, so least-squares analysis of such data yields biased, nonnormally distributed parameters, even when the transformed data are properly weighted in accord with the transformation. Monte Carlo calculations are used to study the effects of such nonnormal data in cases of relevance to the analysis of equilibrium and kinetics data (exponential decay, binding constants, enzyme kinetics, fluorescence quenching, adsorption). Typically 10(5) equivalent data sets are processed to obtain precise information about the parameter biases and distributions. The biases generally persist in the limit of an infinite number of data values, which means that the estimators are not only biased but also inconsistent.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract: The analysis of unbiased, normally distributed (Gaussian) data by linear least-squares yields unbiased, normally distributed parameter estimates, whose standard errors are known exactly if the error structure of the data is known. By contrast, nonlinear models generally yield nonnormal, biased parameter estimates, for which the standard errors depend on the parameter values, hence vary among statistically equivalent data sets. These properties of least squares are examined through Monte Carlo calculations on three important models: the straight-line linear relationship, the rectangular hyperbola of relevance to the analysis of equilibrium binding constant and Michaelis-Menten kinetics data, and the declining exponential. Parameter distributions are precisely characterized by processing 105 equivalent data sets in a typical Monte Carlo run. The main conclusions are as follows. (1) "Exact" parameter errors can be obtained easily from the variance-covariance matrix for a perfectly fitting data set having known data error. (2) The "normal" interpretation of these exact standard errors yields parameter confidence limits that are reliable to better than 10% if the relative standard error is <1/10. (3) Parameter bias scales with the data variance (y2) and is very nearly linear in n-1, where n is the number of data points. (4) With proportional error structures (yi yi) and Poisson structures (yi2 yi), there is an inherent and unavoidable ambiguity in assessing the weights; weights based on either observed or calculated yi lead to bias that persists as n , or inconsistency, in many of the nonlinear estimators. (5) Certain key parameters such as the binding constant and the exponential decay rate are consistent. (6) A common source of highly asymmetric parameter distributions is a parameter which is the reciprocal of a relatively uncertain normal or near-normal parameter; such reciprocal parameters have infinite variance, so when uncertain by 20%, their signature in Monte Carlo calculations is unstable or divergent statistics.},

  Abstract                 = {The interaction of matter with its environment is the driving force behind the evolution of 99% of the observed matter in the universe. The majority of the visible universe exists in a state of weak ionization, the so called fourth state of matter: plasma. Plasmas are ubiquitous, from those occurring naturally; interstellar molecular clouds, cometary comae, circumstellar shells, to those which are anthropic in origin; flames, combustion engines and fusion reactors. The evolution of these plasmas is driven by the interaction of the plasma constituents, the ions, and the electrons. One of the most important subsets of these reactions is electron-molecular ion recombination. This process is significant for two very important reasons. It is an ionization reducing reaction, removing two ionised species and producing neutral products. Furthermore, these products may themselves be reactive radical species which can then further drive the evolution of the plasma. The rate at which the electron reacts with the ion depends on many parameters, for examples the collision energy, the internal energy of the ion, and the structure of the ion itself. Measuring these properties together with the manner in which the system breaks up is therefore critical if the evolution of the environment is to be understood at all. Several techniques have been developed to study just such reactions to obtain the necessary information on the parameters. In this paper the focus will be on one the most recently developed of these, the Ion Storage Ring, together with the detection tools and techniques used to extract the necessary information from the reaction. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., Mass Spec Rev 27: 485-530, 2008},

  Abstract                 = {The reaction of molecular ions with electrons via dissociative recombination is the most important neutralising process in plasmas cold enough to contain molecules. For diatomic ions, the basic features and principles describing reaction process are now reasonably well understood and characterised. For poly-atomic ions, however, the recombination process is much less well understood. To help address this, experiments carried out at ion storage rings have shown that the recombination of poly-atomic molecular ions tend to lead to a high-degree of fragmentation, involving multiple bond breaking and formation. Furthermore, tri-atomic molecular ions are observed to pre-dominantly break up into their constituent atoms upon recombination with free electrons. These observations have been investigated further at ion storage rings using particle-imaging techniques, and this technique will be discussed together with data obtained from studies of H2O+, NH2+ and CH2+. Finally, how this technique could be used to study more complex polyatomic ions will also be discussed, taking D5O2+ as an example.},

  Abstract                 = {In several recent dissociative recombination (DR) experiments, the observed DR products depend on the structure, bonding and charge center of the molecular ion. For examples, the dominant product channel observed in the DR of N2O+2, D+5, and D5O2+ suggests that the former two ions have the form NO+*NO, and D+3*D2, respectively, whilst the latter is known to have the form D2O*D+*D2O. We compare and contrast these observations by investigating the DR of one of the simplest such systems, Li+*H2. This system, a weakly bound cluster with the charge center located on the lithium atom, will provide us with an excellent opportunity for investigating the role played by the type of bonds and charge center in the DR process.},

These expts. are, by design, relevant to the atm. chem. induced by cosmic rays in Titan's troposphere and (at the lower P) to chem. initiated by Saturnian magnetospheric electrons and other charged particle sources which excite stratospheric auroras. At P = 17 mbar, 59 gaseous species including 27 nitriles are detected in overall yield 4.0 (C + N) atoms incorporated into products per 100 eV (heV). At P = 0.24 mbar, 19 species are detected, including 6 nitriles and 3 other unidentified N-bearing compds.; the yield is 0.79 (C + N)/heV, a mild decrease with P. The types of mols. formed change more markedly, with high degrees of multiple bonding at 0.24 mbar prevailing over more H-satd. mols. at 17 mbar. The mols. and yields at 0.24 mbar bear a striking resemblance to the minor constituents found in Titan's atm., all of which are abundant products in the lab. expt. Using the altitude-integrated flux of charged particle energy deposition at Titan, the lab. yields at P = 0.24 mbar, and a simple eddy mixing model, abs. stratospheric column abundances and mole fractions were computed. These are in very good agreement with the Voyager IRIS observations. Except for the primarily photochem. products, C2H6 and C3H8, the match is much better than that obtained by photochem.-kinetic models, demonstrating that properly designed lab. expts. are directly applicable to modeling radiation-chem. processes in planetary atmospheres. On the basis of this agreement; CH3-C.tplbond.n (ethanenitrile = acetonitrile) CH2:CH-CH:CH2 (1,3-butadiene), CH2:C:Ch2 (1,2-propadiene = allene), and CH2:CH-C.tplbond.CH (1-buten-3-yne) to be present at mol fractions X > 10-9, and CH2:CH-C.tplbond.N (propenenitrile), CH3-CH:CH2 (propene), and CH3-CH2-C.tplbond.N (propanenitrile) at X > 10-10 are expected in Titan's atm.

These tholins resemble org. aerosols produced in the atmospheres of Titan, Pluto, and Triton. The tholin yields are large compared to the total yield of gaseous products: nominally, 13 (C + N)/100 eV for Titan tholin and 2.1 (C + N)/100 eV for Triton tholin. High-energy magnetospheric electrons responsible for tholin prodn. represent a class distinct from the plasma electrons considered in models of Titan's airglow. Electrons with E > 20 keV provide an energy flux .apprx.1 * 10-2 erg cm-2 sec-1, implying from our measured tholin yields a mass flux of 0.5 to 4.0 * 10-14 g cm-2 sec-1 of tholin. The corresponding thickness of the tholin sedimentary column accumulated over 4 Gyr on Titan's surface is 4-30 m. This figure is in agreement with required mass fluxes computed from recent radiative transfer and sedimentation models. If, however, these results, derived from expts. at .apprx.2 mb, are applied to lower pressure levels toward peak auroral electron energy deposition and scaled with pressure as the gas-phase org. yields, the derived tholin mass flux is at least an order of magnitude less. We attribute this difference to the fact that tholin synthesis occurs well below the level of max. electron energy deposition and to possible contributions to tholins from UV-derived C2-hydrocarbons. The Titan tholin, produced by magnetospheric electrons, is alone sufficient to supply at least a significant fraction of Titan's haze; this result is consistent with the fact that the optical properties of Titan tholin, among all proposed materials, are best at reproducing Titan's geometric albedo spectrum from near UV to mid-IR in light-scattering models.

H2O (or H2O + NH3) lasting .apprx.1000 yr, allowing some aq. org. chem. at T .ltorsim. 273 K to occur. Furthermore, decompression of impact-shocked H2O ice against the 1.5 bar surface pressure results in substantial amts. (.gtorsim.10%) of liq. and should produce extensive ejecta blankets. For blanket-to-crater diam. ratios similar to those seen on Mars, .apprx.60-90% of Titan's surface, over its history, would have been exposed to liq. H2O for times of .apprx.minutes (for entrainment-cooled slurry) to .apprx.200 yr (for .apprx.100 m-deep flows or ponds of liq. ejecta). Aq. ejecta entrain and dissolve large amts. of org.-bearing regolith, resulting in high concns. of nitriles and other reactive species.

Selected equil. and enthalpy data are used in a max. likelihood detn. of model parameters. The model can be readily evaluated to compute the satn. criteria, compn. of condensate, and latent heat in Titan's atm. for a given pressure-temp. (P-T) profile. For a nominal P-T profile, the partial pressure of CH4 required for formation of CH4 + N2 condensate is .apprx.20% lower than that required to sat. pure CH4, and .apprx.25% higher than that which would be computed by Raoult's law. N2 constitutes 16-30% of the cloud condensate, and higher altitude clouds are generally more N2-rich. The N2 content of condensate is .apprx.1/2 of that computed from Raoult's law and about 30% greater than that computed from Henry's law. Heats of condensation are .apprx.10% lower than for pure CH4. Above 14 km altitude, the liq. soln. becomes metastable with respect to a solid soln. contg. less N2: freezing of liq. droplets will be accompanied by the exsoln. of about 30% of the dissolved N2, probably leading to an underdense, porous texture. The refractive index, single-scattering albedo, and d. of CH4 + N2 cloud droplets of the appropriate compn. and phase should be used in modeling and spacecraft planning studies for Titan.

This family includes the traditional Dirichlet distribution as a special member and can be adopted to analyze incomplete categorical data. However, other important aspects of the family, such as marginal and conditional distributions and related properties are not yet available in the literature. Moreover, diverse applications of the family to the real world need to be further explored. In this paper, we first obtain the marginal and conditional distributions and other related properties of the nested Dirichlet distribution. We then present new applications of the family in fitting competing-risks model, analyzing incomplete categorical data and evaluating cancer diagnosis tests. Three real data involving failure times of radio transmitter receivers, attitude toward the death penalty and ultrasound ratings for breast cancer metastasis are provided.},

Titan's thunderclouds may be quite rare because of the difficult methane nucleation and low convection energy, but once moist convection is triggered, a massive cloud contg. slowly falling solid and liq. methane particles may be expected. In this case the cloud rapidly attaches a large amt. of free electrons, which are abundant in Titan's troposphere due to the low abundance of electrophilic species. The entirely neg. space charge in the cloud causes within a few minutes a temporary max. elec. field of 2*106 V m-1 which is sufficient to initiate 20 km long neg. cloud-to-ground lightning strokes in Titan's lower troposphere. The collisional charging, on the other hand, appears to be less efficient since the charge transfer itself may be limited at Titan's cold temps. and no substantial charge redistribution takes place in the cloud due to the weak updraft and gravitation.

  Abstract                 = {The tropospheric methane cycle on Titan including advection, diffusion, condensation, pptn., evapn., and surface source is simulated by a three-dimensional general circulation model. The model takes into account the different nucleation of methane in Titan's troposphere, and assumes condensation whenever the satn. ratio (relative humidity) exceeds a crit. value of either 100 or 150%. The simulation with the latter crit. satn. is shown to be more compatible with the Voyager data. The meridional circulation accounts for a seasonal methane transport from the winter to summer hemisphere in the mid-troposphere, causing a higher supersatn. in late summer and early autumn. Condensation preferentially occurs in this season at 15 km altitude at low latitudes. The occasional character may be explained by the high crit. satn. ratio, which cannot be often exceeded. Falling rain evaps. during the descent, so no rain arrives at the surface. The hydrol. cycle of methane on Titan takes place mostly within the atm. The latitudinal methane distribution near the surface cannot be reproduced by transport, evapn., condensation, and combinations of them, indicating some undetd. surface processes affecting the methane distribution. The zonal and meridional circulation is sensitive to the methane distribution. (c) 2001 Academic Press. [on SciFinder (R)]},

H composes 0.2-0.6% of the atm. The CH4 relative humidity at the surface may be >60%. CH4 clouds probably exist at altitudes <10-.apprx.30 km. The cloud particle radius is probably >50 mm so that the particles should be classified as rain. The optical depth of the clouds that are present is typically of the order of 2-5 in both the IR and the visible. The clouds are probably patchy. The clouds have only a small effect on the IR spectrum of Titan, and probably are not significant for visible radiation either. The large particle sizes and low cloud optical depths on Titan relative to Earth can be understood if Titan's high altitude haze is the major source of condensation nuclei. Then particle growth is not limited by low supersatn. until raindrop sizes are reached. H and the high altitude haze play an important role in the IR interferometer spectra 500-600 cm-1. Latitudinal variations in the brightness temp. at these wavenos. may be due primarily to obsd. variations in the temp. of the haze layer, rather than variations in the temp. of the surface.

  Abstract                 = {Titan's spectrum at moderate resoln. is compared with and contrasted to Saturn's spectrum from 5800 to 12,000 .ANG.. The filling-in of Titan's bands arises partly from a curve-of-growth effect caused by the different pressures and visible-methane abundances in the 2 atms. Most of Titan's bands are satd. in the sense that the absorption of both their stronger and weaker lines is affected by the pressure. On the other hand, the weaker lines of Saturn's bands lie essentially on the linear part of the curve of growth. In principle, this permits us to evaluate the parameters of a band model describing the mean transmission vs. wavelength for a given band by using the spectra of both planets simultaneously. The reflecting layer model, however, cannot be reconciled with the observations of Titan. This is true whether or not results from an anal. of the R(5) manifold of Titan's 3n3 CH4 band are considered. This implies that aerosol scattering plays a significant role in Titan's band formation. The most likely candidate for such an aerosol is frozen CH4 particles. [on SciFinder (R)]},

Titan's bands exhibit a progressive washing out with increasing wavelength relative to the corresponding bands in Saturn's spectrum.

Greater absorption is also obsd. in the 1.1 m region. Not all of the phenomena can be explained by enhanced CH4 absorption, so Titan's spectrum implies the existence of another spectroscopically active gas. Several candidates for this gas are briefly considered. In a no. of ways, Titan's far ir spectral features approx. those in the spectrum of Uranus more closely than those in the spectrum of Saturn.

Consideration of the phys. constraints for Titan's atm. leads to a model which describes the bulk compn. in terms of observable parameters. Intermediate-resoln. photometric scans of both Saturn and Titan, including scans of the Q-branch of Titan's 3n3 CH4 band, constrain these parameters in such a way that the model indicates the presence of another important atm. gas, namely, another bulk constituent or a significant thermal opacity.

  Abstract                 = {Detailed analysis of the R(5) manifold of Titan's 3[nu]3 CH4 band confirms that the column abundance of Titan's spectroscopically visible atmosphere is greater than 1.6 kmamagats. This agrees with the value estimated from the strength of Titan's 3[nu]3 CH4 Q branch and is at least 25 times the value for the column abundance of Mars' atmosphere. Moreover, the enhanced strength of the weaker CH4 lines in Titan's spectrum relative to Saturn's spectrum suggests that CH4 constitutes a significant fraction of this bulk. Recently discovered strong, unidentified absorptions in Titan's spectrum at 1.05-1.06 [mu]m have been compared with laboratory spectra of a number of gases including CH4, C2H4, C2H6, and C3H8 with negative results. These comparisons, however, have not excluded the possibility that these features arise from a very large quantity of CH4 or from an isotope of CH4. The fundamental transition of the responsible molecule may affect the interpretation of Titan's 8-14 [mu]m spectrum since its wavelength may lie in this window. Comparison with Uranus' spectrum suggests that the visible abundance of this molecule in Titan's atmosphere may be much greater than in Uranus' relatively clear, deep atmosphere. Spectra of features at [lambda]8150.7 and [lambda]8272.7 attributed possibly to H2 have been obtained at high resolution also during the apparitions of 1971, 1972, and 1973. These are presented for comparison with the results of the 1970 apparition. The existence of the [lambda]8150.7 feature is established definitively but further observations are needed to establish whether the [lambda]8272.7 feature exists beyond doubt.},

Our results for particles produced from a mixt. of 10% CH4 in N2 are consistent with a large, fraction of aroms., including specific m/z peaks likely due to PAHs. However, at lower concns. of CH4 (1% and lower), the mass fraction of PAHs greatly diminishes, and an aliph. pathway dominates.

A mixt. of gases that approx. their mixing ratios on Titan (N2, CH4, H2, C2H2, C2H4, and HC3N) (0.98, 0.018, 0.002, 3.5 * 10-4, 3 * 10-4, 1.7 * 10-5, resp.) was irradiated in the flow photochem. reactor using a 185-nm source to give a Titan haze analog as a solid product. XPS gave a compn. of 93.3% C, 5.3% N, and 1.4% O. Of the 93.3% carbon, high-resoln. XPS revealed that 81.2% was present as C-H, C-C, and C:C groups, 12.1% may be C-O, C-N, C:N, -C.tplbond.N, and/or C.tplbond.N groups, 5.3% as a -C.tplbond.N group. The peak for N was sym. and was assigned to the -C.tplbond.N while that for oxygen was assigned to the C:O and/or the C-O group. Some of these assignments were confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy. The polymeric product had a C:N ratio of 17.6, which is significantly greater than that for Titan haze analogs prepd. in discharge reactions. When the polymer was exposed to air for seven days the oxygen content increased by 6% along with an increase in the IR absorption at 1710 cm-1 assigned to the C:O group of a ketone. The oxidn. is attributed to the reaction of oxygen with free radicals trapped in the polymer matrix. It is proposed that the photochem. initiation of Titan haze formation from compds. formed from starting materials formed high in Titan's atm. is a more plausible model than haze formed in reactions initiated by solely by discharges. These data will be helpful in the interpretation of the data returned from the Huygens probe of the Cassini mission. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  Abstract                 = {The formation of organic compounds in the atmosphere of Titan is an ongoing process of the generation of complex organics from the simplest hydrocarbon, methane. Solar radiation and magnetosphere electrons are the main energy sources that drive the reactions in Titan's atmosphere. Since energy from solar radiation is 200 times greater than that from magnetosphere electrons, we have investigated the products formed by the action of UV radiation (185 and 254 nm) on a mixture of gases containing nitrogen, methane, hydrogen, acetylene, ethylene, and cyanoacetylene, the basic gas mixture (BGM) that simulates aspects of Titan's atmosphere using a flow reactor [Tran, B.N., Ferris, J.P., Chera, J.J., 2003a. Icarus 162, 114-124; Tran, B.N., Joseph, J.C., Force, M., Briggs, R.G., Vuitton, V., Ferris, J.P., 2005. Icarus 177, 106-115]. The present research extends these studies by the addition of carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide to the BGM. Quantum yields for the loss of reactants and the formation of volatile products were determined and compared with those measured in the absence of the hydrogen cyanide and carbon monoxide. The GCMS analyses of the volatile photolysis products from the BGM, with added hydrogen cyanide, had a composition similar to that of the BGM while the photolysis products of the BGM with added carbon monoxide contained many oxygenated compounds. The infrared spectrum of the corresponding solid product revealed the absorption band of a ketone group, which was probably formed from the reaction of carbon monoxide with the free radicals generated by photolysis of acetylene and ethylene. Of particular interest was the observation that the addition of HCN to the gas mixture only resulted in a very small change in the C/N ratio and in the intensity of the CN frequency at 2210 cm-1 in the infrared spectrum suggesting that little HCN is incorporated into the haze analog. The C/N ratio of the haze analogs was found to be in the 10-12 range. The UV spectra of the solid products formed when HCN or CO added to the BGM is similar to the UV absorption formed from the BGM alone. This result is consistent with absence of additional UV chromophores to the solid product when these mixtures are photolyzed. The following photoproducts, which were not starting materials in our photochemical studies, have been observed on Titan: acetonitrile, benzene, diacetylene, ethane, propene, propane, and propyne.},

  Abstract                 = {Solar UV is the principal energy source impinging the atm. of Titan while the energy from the electrons in Saturn's magnetosphere is less than 0.5% of the UV light. Titan haze analogs were prepd. by the photolysis of a mixt. of gases that simulate the compn. of its atm. (nitrogen, methane, hydrogen, acetylene, ethylene, and cyanoacetylene). The real (n) and imaginary (k) parts of the complex refractive index of haze analogs formed from four different gas mixts. were calcd. from the spectral properties of the solid polymer in UV-visible, near IR and IR wavelength spectral regions. The value of n was const. at 1.6+-0.1 throughout the 0.2-2.5 mm region. The variation of k with wavelength for the values derived for Titan has a lower error than the abs. values of k so the more significant comparisons are with the slopes of the k(l) plots in the UV-VIS region. Three of the photochem. Titan haze analogs had slopes comparable to those derived for Titan from the Voyager data (Rages and Pollack, 1980, Icarus 41, 119-130; McKay and Toon, 1992, in: Proceedings of the Symposium on Titan, in: ESA SP, Vol. 338, pp. 185-190). The slopes of the k(l) plots for haze analogs prepd. by spark discharge (Khare et al., 1984, Icarus 60, 127-137) and plasma discharge (Ramirez et al., 2002, Icarus 156, 515-529) were also comparable to Titan's. These findings show that the k(l) plots do not differentiate between different lab. simulations of atm. chem. on Titan in the UV-VIS near IR region (0.2-2.5 m). There is a large difference between the k(l) in the IR between the haze analogs prepd. photochem. and analogs prepd. using a plasma discharges (Khare et al., 1984, Icarus 60, 127-137; Coll et al., 1999, Planet. Space Sci. 47, 1331-1340; Khare et al., 2002, Icarus 160,172-182). The C/N ratio in the haze analog prepd. by discharges is in the 2-11 range while that of the photochem. analogs is in the 18-24 range. The use of discharges and UV light for initiating the chem. in Titan's atm. is discussed. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  Abstract                 = {Generalized Born (GB) models provide an attractive way to include some thermodynamic aspects of aqueous solvation into simulations that do not explicitly model the solvent molecules. Here we discuss our recent experience with this model, presenting in detail the way it is implemented and parallelized in the AMBER molecular modeling code. We compare results using the GB model (or GB plus a surface-area based ldquohydrophobicrdquo term) to explicit solvent simulations for a 10 base-pair DNA oligomer, and for the 108-residue protein thioredoxin. A slight modification of our earlier suggested parameters makes the GB results more like those found in explicit solvent, primarily by slightly increasing the strength of NH&bond;O and NH&bond;N internal hydrogen bonds. Timing and energy stability results are reported, with an eye toward using these model for simulations of larger macromolecular systems and longer time scales. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Derived scale heights plus other exptl. and theor. results indicate that mol. N is the predominant atm. constituent. The surface pressure and temp. appear to be ~1.6 bars and 93 K, resp. The main clouds are probably CH4 ice, although some condensation of N cannot be ruled out. Solar abundance arguments suggest and the measurements allow large quantities of surface CH4 near its triple-point temp., so that the 3 phases of CH4 could play roles in the atm. and on the surface of Titan similar to those of H2O on Earth. The min. temp. is about 91 K near the 60-millibar pressure level. The measured part of the polar ionosphere of Saturn has a peak electron concn. of 2.3 * 104 cm-3 at an altitude of 2500 km above the 1-bar level in the atm., and a plasma scale height at the top of the ionosphere of 560 km. Attenuation of monochromic radiation at a wavelength of 3.6 cm propagating obliquely through Saturn's rings is consistent with traditional values for the normal optical depth of the rings, but the near-forward scattering of this radiation by the rings indicates effective scattering particles with larger than expected diams. of 10, 8, and 2 m in the A ring, the outer Cassini division, and the C ring, resp. Preliminary anal. of the radio tracking data yields new values for the masses of Saturn. Corresponding values for the mean densities of these object are 1.33 +- 0.10 and ~1.89 g/cm3. The d. of Rhea is consistent with a solar-compn. mix of anhyd. rock and volatiles, while Titan is apparently enriched in silicates relative to the solar compn. [on SciFinder (R)]},

Electron attachment to both of these compounds is efficient over this temperature range and the rate coefficient for attachment is relatively independent of temperature. At 295 K the electron attachment rate coefficient for c-C5F6Cl2 is 2.5 ± 0.6 × 10-7 cm3 s-1 and for c-C6F8Cl2 is 3.5 ± 0.9 × 10-7 cm3 s-1. At 300 K, electron attachment to both neutral reactants is predominantly nondissociative. At higher temperatures, a dissociative reaction channel forming Cl- is observed for both reaction systems. Significant branching fractions for Cl- (>=0.05) are observed at temperatures greater than 425 K for c-C5F6Cl2 and at temperatures greater than 375 K for c-C6F8Cl2. Over the temperature range of 300-550 K the branching fractions for formation of the nondissociative and dissociative products were not dependent on buffer gas density in the range of 1.3-2.1 × 1016 cm-3.},

From analysis of thermodynamic data found in the literature, there is clear evidence of the presence of systematic errors, in particular, for liquid-liquid equilibria data. For systematic errors, the data are perturbed systematically with a rectangular probability distribution, and to analyze random errors, the perturbation is carried out randomly with normal probability distributions. Thermodynamic parameters are obtained from appropriate regression methods and used to simulate a given unit operation and to obtain cumulative frequency distributions, providing a quantitative risk assessment and a better understanding of the role of uncertainty in process design and simulation. The results show that the proposed method can clearly distinguish when one type of error is more significant. Potential applications are safety factors, process modeling, and experimental design.},

  Abstract                 = {The effects of uncertainty in thermophysical properties on the evaluation of the environmental performance is demonstrated with a chemical process to recover toluene and ethyl acetate by absorption from a gaseous waste stream of a cellophane production plant. In this case study, the environmental performance is defined as the estimation of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and total emissions of the plant and of several environmental risk indexes. We found that estimations of VOCs are very sensitive to uncertainty in thermophysical properties such as infinite-dilution activity coefficients, and vapor pressures (through uncertain temperature variations). Additionally, we concluded that calculation of the total emissions can be very sensitive to fuel content factors such as those used to estimate greenhouse gases. This can have such an impact on the emission calculations that a detailed model of the given chemical process might not be required for the estimation of the total emissions. In other words, a simpler process flowsheet model can perform the same task just as well, with the results within the variations caused by uncertainty in the thermophysical properties. We demonstrate a Monte Carlo approach that allows the detection of such uncertainty characteristics in a design, providing a rational basis for prediction of the associated environmental risks. This procedure also enables the deconvolution of various sources of uncertainty, and the estimation of physical property uncertainty through a similarity approach. We concluded that our framework can be used to enhance decision making by uncovering uncertainties and sensitivities in chemical process simulation. © 2004 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 2004},

  Abstract                 = {A novel approach called equal probability sampling (EPS) is used for analyzing uncertainty and sensitivity in thermodynamic models. Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis for simulation and design of industrial processes are becoming increasingly important. The (EPS) method produces more realistic results in uncertainty analysis than methods based on other sampling techniques such as Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) or shifted Hammersley sampling (SHS), when parameters are highly correlated. When parameters are not correlated, EPS reduces to the LHS method. The EPS method is based on resampling to obtain uniform coverage over level sets of the objective function used to obtain the parameters of the model. The existence of unfeasible situations is substantially reduced with EPS. It can be extended to any regression model describing other kinds of physical applications and can be used as a better tool to estimate more reliable safety factors in the design and simulation of industrial chemical processes.},

  Abstract                 = {We study how uncertainties in the rate coefficients of chemical reactions in the RATE 06 database affect abundances and column densities of key molecules in protoplanetary disks. We randomly varied the gas-phase reaction rates within their uncertainty limits and calculated the time-dependent abundances and column densities using a gas-grain chemical model and a flaring steady state disk model. We find that key species can be separated into two distinct groups according to the sensitivity of their column densities to the rate uncertainties. The first group includes CO, C+, $<$IMG SRC="eq-00001.gif" ALT="\\mathrm{H}\\,\^{}{+}_{3}"/$>$ H+3, H2O, NH3, N2H+, and HCNH+. For these species the column densities are not very sensitive to the rate uncertainties, but the abundances in specific regions are. The second group includes CS, CO2, HCO+, H2CO, C2H, CN, HCN, HNC, and other, more complex species, for which high abundances and abundance uncertainties coexist in the same disk region, leading to larger scatters in column densities. However, even for complex and heavy molecules, the dispersion in their column densities is not more than a factor of \~{}4. We perform a sensitivity analysis of the computed abundances to rate uncertainties and identify those reactions with the most problematic rate coefficients. We conclude that the rate coefficients of about a hundred chemical reactions need to be determined more accurately in order to greatly improve the reliability of modern astrochemical models. This improvement should be an ultimate goal of future laboratory studies and theoretical investigations.},

Branching ratios for dissociative recombination into different electronic states of the atomic fragments have also been determined by an imaging technique. More than 80% of the dissociative recombination events at E = 0 eV produced N(2D) + O(3P). The rotational temperature of the NO+ ion beam was changed by a factor of 2 by employing different types of ion sources. The branching ratios and the dissociative recombination cross section as a function of energy were independent of the rotational temperature. The dissociative recombination cross section was proportional to E-1 at low energies and had peaks in the energy regions 3–8 eV and 10–16 eV. We obtain a total dissociative recombination rate α = 4×10-7 cm3/s at T=300 K for NO+ in the vibrational ground state.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract: In this work, we study the robustness of nonlinear regression methods under uncertainty for parameter estimation for chemical kinetics models. We used Monte Carlo simulation to study the influence of two main types of uncertainty, namely, random errors and incomplete experimental data sets. The regression methods analyzed were least-squares minimization (LSM), maximum likelihood (ML), and a method that automatically reweights the objective function during the course of the optimization called IVEM (inside-variance estimation method). Although this work represents a preliminary attempt toward understanding the effects of uncertainty in nonlinear regression, the results from the analysis of the case studies indicate that the performance of the regression procedures can be highly sensitive to uncertainty due to random errors and incomplete data sets. The results also suggest that traditional methods of assigning weights a priori to regression functions can affect the performance of the regression unless these weights correspond to a careful characterization of the residual statistics of the regression problem. In the case in which there is no prior knowledge of these weights (particularly in maximum likelihood regression), we suggest that they be characterized, in a preliminary way, by performing a least-squares minimization regression first or by using a method that automatically estimates these weights during the course of the regression (IVEM). We believe that the performance of regression techniques under uncertainty requires attention before a regression method is chosen or the parameters obtained are deemed valid.},

The technique is capable of temperatures at least as high as 1400 K, and here we report the branching ratios for the reactions of O2+ with CH4 and CD4 measured at 1400 K (for the reaction of O2+ with CH4, the rate constant was also measured). Comparison to work using drift tube and guided ion beam techniques shows that heating the CH4 vibrations produces new reaction product channels and enhances others. In particular, HCO+, CH3O+, and H2O+ products are seen for the first time, and the H3O+ product is much more intense in comparison with experiments on vibrationally cold CH4. The previously observed products CH3+ and CH4+ are comparable to those found with vibrationally cold CH4. We conclude that vibrational excitation promotes those channels which require extensive bond rearrangement. Vibrational energy is found not only to promote the new channels but also to enhance the overall reaction rate.},

It has been found that at [?]2 meV relative kinetic energy about 50\% of the DR events involve only ruptures of X-H bonds (where X = C or N) while the rest leads to the production of a pair of fragments each containing two heavy atoms (alongside H and/or H2). The absolute DR cross section has been investigated for relative kinetic energies ranging from [?]1 meV to 1 eV. The thermal rate coefficient has been determined to follow the expression k(T) = 1.78 x 10-6 (T/300) - 0.80 cm3 s-1 for electron temperatures ranging from [?]10 to 1000 K. Gas-phase models of the nitrile chemistry in the dark molecular cloud TMC-1 have been run and results are compared with observations. Also, implications of the present results for the nitrile chemistry of Titan's upper atmosphere are discussed.},

We analyzed two sets of spectra, one at 15[degree sign] S (Tb flyby) and the other one at 80[degree sign] N (T3 flyby). The spectral range 600-1400 cm-1, recorded at a resolution of 0.5 cm-1, was used to determine molecular abundances and temperatures in the stratosphere in the altitude range 100-460 km for Tb and 170-495 km for T3. Both temperature profiles show a well defined stratopause, at around 310 km (0.07 mbar) and 183 K at 13[degree sign] S, and 380 km (0.01 mbar) with 207 K at 80[degree sign] N. Near the north pole, stratospheric temperatures are colder and mesospheric temperatures are warmer than near the equator. C2H2, C2H6, C3H8 and HCN display vertical mixing ratio profiles that increase with height at 15[degree sign] S and 80[degree sign] N, consistent with their formation in the upper atmosphere, diffusion downwards and condensation in the lower stratosphere, as expected from photochemical models. The CH3C2H and C4H2 mixing ratios also increase with height at 15[degree sign] S. But near the north pole, their profiles present an unexpected minimum around 300 km, observed for the first time thanks to the high vertical resolution of the CIRS limb data. C2H4 is the only molecule having a vertical abundance profile that decreases with height at 15[degree sign] S. At 80[degree sign] N, it also displays a minimum of its mixing ratio around the 0.1-mbar level. For C6H6, an upper limit of 1.1 ppb (in the 0.3-10 mbar range) is derived at 15[degree sign] S, whereas a constant mixing ratio profile of is inferred near the north pole. At 15[degree sign] S, the vertical profile of HCN exhibits a steeper gradient than other molecules, which suggests that a sink for this molecule exists in the stratosphere, possibly due to haze formation. All molecules display a more or less pronounced enrichment towards the north pole, probably due, in part, to subsidence of air at the north (winter) pole that brings air enriched in photochemical compounds from the upper atmosphere to lower levels.},

  Abstract                 = {We report the detection of H13CN and HC15N in mid-infrared spectra recorded by the Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) aboard Cassini, along with the determination of the 12C/13C and 14N/15N isotopic ratios. We analyzed two sets of limb spectra recorded near 13-15[degree sign] S (Tb flyby) and 83[degree sign] N (T4 flyby) at 0.5 cm-1 resolution. The spectral range 1210-1310 cm-1 was used to retrieve the temperature profile in the range 145-490 km at 13[degree sign] S and 165-300 km at 83[degree sign] N. These two temperature profiles were then incorporated in the atmospheric model to retrieve the abundance profile of H12C14N, H13CN and HC15N from their bands at 713, 706 and 711 cm-1, respectively. The HCN abundance profile was retrieved in the range 90-460 km at 15[degree sign] S and 165-305 km at 83[degree sign] N. There is no evidence for vertical variations of the isotopic ratios. Constraining the isotopic abundance profiles to be proportional to the HCN one, we find at 15[degree sign] S, and at 83[degree sign] N, two values that are statistically consistent. A combination of these results yields a 12C/13C value equal to 75+/-12. This global result, as well as the 15[degree sign] S one, envelop the value in Titan's methane (82.3+/-1) [Niemann, H.B., and 17 colleagues, 2005. Nature 438, 779-784] measured at 10[degree sign] S and is slightly lower than the terrestrial inorganic standard value (89). The 14N/15N isotopic ratio is found equal to at 15[degree sign] S and at 83[degree sign] N. Combining the two values yields 14N/15N = 56 +/- 8, which corresponds to an enrichment in 15N of about 4.9 compared with the terrestrial ratio. These results agree with the values obtained from previous ground-based millimeter observations [Hidayat, T., Marten, A., Bezard, B., Gautier, D., Owen, T., Matthews, H.E., Paubert, G., 1997. Icarus 126, 170-182; Marten, A., Hidayat, T., Biraud, Y., Moreno, R., 2002. Icarus 158, 532-544]. The 15N/14N ratio found in HCN is ~3 times higher than in N2 [Niemann, H.B., and 17 colleagues, 2005. Nature 438, 779-784], which implies a large fractionation process in the HCN photochemistry.},

This state, probably a triplet excited state, seems to be a precursor in the photochem. reactions occurring in the atm. of Titan. Std. matrix isolation technique assocd. with time resolved spectroscopy is well adapted to characterize metastable states. Absorption and emission spectra (phosphorescence) of C4H2 in rare gas matrixes are presented and a vibrational anal. is conducted. We also report the first exptl. intrinsic lifetime of C4H*2, measured in Ar and Kr matrixes. A value of about 100 ms in the gas phase is deduced from matrixes results (.apprx.45 ms in Ar and .apprx.20 ms in Kr). The detd. lifetime of C4H2, despite being two orders of magnitude higher than the value currently used in the models, cannot explain the discrepancy between models and observations.

  Abstract                 = {The Electron Spectrometer (ELS), one of the sensors making up the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS) revealed the existence of numerous negative ions in Titan's upper atmosphere. The observations at closest approach (~1000 km) show evidence for negatively charged ions up to ~10,000 amu/q, as well as two distinct peaks at 22±4 and 44±8 amu/q, and maybe a third one at 82±14 amu/q. We present the first ionospheric model of Titan including negative ion chemistry. We find that dissociative electron attachment to neutral molecules (mostly HCN) initiates the formation of negative ions. The negative charge is then transferred to more acidic molecules such as HC3N, HC5N or C4H2. Loss occurs through associative detachment with radicals (H and CH3). We attribute the three low mass peaks observed by ELS to CN-, C3N-/C4H- and C5N-. These species are the first intermediates in the formation of the even larger negative ions observed by ELS, which are most likely the precursors to the aerosols observed at lower altitudes.},

  Abstract                 = {A better understanding of the complex org. chem. occurring in the methane-rich atm. of Titan can be achieved via the comparison of observations with results obtained by theor. models. Available observations are still few but their anal. requires the knowledge of a large set of data, namely frequencies and abs. band intensities. Cross sections are also needed to develop the chem. schemes of photochem. models, in particular the schemes leading to the formation of haze particles visible on Titan. Unfortunately, some of these parameters are not well known, esp. if one takes into account the extreme phys. conditions of the studied object. This lack of data is particularly enhanced for polyynes because these compds. are highly unstable at the usual pressure and temp. conditions of a lab. and therefore are very difficult to study. We have developed UV and IR studies, coupling exptl. and theor. approaches, in order to extrapolate the parameters available for short polyynes to longer carbon chains. In the mid-UV range, when the length of the chain increases, the absorption system of polyynes is shifted to longer wavelength and its oscillator strength increases linearly. In the IR range, with the increase of the no. of carbon bonds, the positions of the CCC and CCH bending modes shift to lower energy, the latest converging rapidly to a fixed value of 620.5 cm-1 for an infinite length polyyne. Implications for detection and evolution of polyynes in Titan's atm. are emphasized. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  Abstract                 = {We present a study of the formation and distribution of benzene (C6H6) on Titan. Analysis of the Cassini Mass Spectrometer (INMS) measurements of benzene densities on 12 Titan passes shows that the benzene signal exhibits an unusual time dependence, peaking &#8764;20 s after closest approach, rather than at closest approach. We show that this behavior can be explained by recombination of phenyl radicals (C6H5) with H atoms on the walls of the instrument and that the measured signal is a combination of (1) C6H6 from the atmosphere and (2) C6H6 formed within the instrument. In parallel, we investigate Titan benzene chemistry with a set of photochemical models. A model for the ionosphere predicts that the globally averaged production rate of benzene by ion-molecule reactions is &#8764;107 cm&#8722;2 s&#8722;1, of the same order of magnitude as the production rate by neutral reactions of &#8764;4 × 106 cm&#8722;2 s&#8722;1. We show that benzene is quickly photolyzed in the thermosphere, and that C6H5 radicals, the main photodissociation products, are &#8764;3 times as abundant as benzene. This result is consistent with the phenyl/benzene ratio required to match the INMS observations. Loss of benzene occurs primarily through reaction of phenyl with other radicals, leading to the formation of complex aromatic species. These species, along with benzene, diffuse downward, eventually condensing near the tropopause. We find a total production rate of solid aromatics of &#8764;10&#8722;15 g cm&#8722;2 s&#8722;1, corresponding to an accumulated surface layer of &#8764;3 m.},

  Abstract                 = {Titan has long been known to harbour the richest atmospheric chemistry in the Solar System. Until recently, it had been believed that complex hydrocarbons and nitriles were produced through neutral chemistry that would eventually lead to the formation of micrometre sized organic aerosols. However, recent measurements by the Cassini spacecraft are drastically changing our understanding of Titan's chemistry. The Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) and the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS) revealed an extraordinary complex ionospheric composition. INMS detected roughly 50 positive ions with /<100 and a density higher than 0.1âcm. CAPS provided evidence for heavy (up to 350âamu) positively and negatively charged (up to 4000âamu) ions. These observations all indicate that Titan's ionospheric chemistry is incredibly complex and that molecular growth starts in the upper atmosphere rather than at lower altitude. Here, we review the recent progress made on ionospheric chemistry. The presence of heavy neutrals in the upper atmosphere has been inferred as a direct consequence of the presence of complex positive ions. Benzene (CH) is created by ion chemistry at high altitudes and its main photolysis product, the phenyl radical (CH), is at the origin of the formation of aromatic species at lower altitude.},

  Abstract                 = {High-energy photons, electrons, and ions initiate ion-neutral chemistry in Titan's upper atmosphere by ionizing the major neutral species (nitrogen and methane). The Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) onboard the Cassini spacecraft performed the first composition measurements of Titan's ionosphere. INMS revealed that Titan has the most compositionally complex ionosphere in the Solar System, with roughly 50 ions at or above the detection threshold. Modeling of the ionospheric composition constrains the density of minor neutral constituents, most of which cannot be measured with any other technique. The species identified with this approach include the most complex molecules identified so far on Titan. This confirms the long-thought idea that a very rich chemistry is actually taking place in this atmosphere. However, it appears that much of the interesting chemistry occurs in the upper atmosphere rather than at lower altitudes. The species observed by INMS are probably the first intermediates in the formation of even larger molecules. As a consequence, they affect the composition of the bulk atmosphere, the composition and optical properties of the aerosols and the flux of condensable material to the surface. In this paper, we discuss the production and loss reactions for the ions and how this affects the neutral densities. We compare our results to neutral densities measured in the stratosphere by other instruments, to production yields obtained in laboratory experiments simulating Titan's chemistry and to predictions of photochemical models. We suggest neutral formation mechanisms and highlight needs for new experimental and theoretical data.},

This study is based on measurements by five instruments (RPWS/LP, RPWS/E, INMS, CAPS/ELS, CAPS/IBS) onboard the Cassini spacecraft during three flybys (T17, T18, T32) of Titan. The ionospheric peaks encountered at altitudes of 950-1300 km had densities in the range 900-3000 cm-3. Below these peaks the number densities of heavy positively charged ions reached 100-2000 cm-3 and approached 50-70% of the total ionospheric density with an increasing trend toward lowest measured altitudes. Simultaneously measured negatively charged ion densities were in the range 50-150 cm-3. These results imply that ~105-106 heavy positively charged ions/m3/s are continuously recombining into heavy neutrals and supply the atmosphere of Titan. The ionosphere may in this way produce 0.1-1 Mt/yr of heavy organic compounds and is therefore a sizable source for aerosol formation. We also predict that Titan's ionosphere is dominated by heavy (>100 amu) molecular ions below 950 km.},

  Abstract                 = {Measurements with the Cassini Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) and two Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS) sensors, the Ion beam Spectrometer (IBS) and the Electron Spectrometer (ELS), have revealed the presence of a significant population of heavy hydrocarbon and nitrile species well above the homopause, with masses as large as several thousand Daltons (Da). The INMS ion and neutral spectra cover the mass range 1â100 Da. The IBS has measured positive ions up to 350 Da, while the ELS has detected concentrations of negative ions as high as 20% of the total negatively charged ionosphere component extending to over 13,000 Da. These measurements have motivated the development of new atmospheric models and have significant implications for our knowledge and understanding of Titan's haze layers.

 The existence of a thick haze obscuring Titan's surface was inferred from remote-sensing observations at infrared and ultraviolet
 wavelengths during the mid-1970s (Danielson et al. 1973; Veverka 1973; Zellner 1973; Trafton 1975) and confirmed by Voyager 1 and 2 imaging, which revealed the existence of two principal haze layers, a main layer and a
 thin detached layer ~100 km above it, both merging at high northern latitudes (Smith et al. 1981, 1982). It was recognized early on (e.g., Danielson et al. 1973) that photochemistry occurring in the upper atmosphere of Titan was the likely source of the haze-forming aerosols, and in
 the years leading up to the Voyager encounters several laboratory experiments were performed in an attempt to synthesize materials
 whose properties were similar to those of the postulated hazes (see reviews by Chang et al. 1979 and Cabane and Chassefière 1995). Substances investigated as possible candidates for the haze-forming aerosols included polymers of acetylene, ethylene,
 and HCN (Scattergood and Owen 1977; Podolak and Bar-Nun 1979) and “tholins,” complex organic solids, brownish in color, produced in a simulated reducing planetary atmosphere through
 UV irradiation and electric discharge (Khare and Sagan 1973; Sagan and Khare 1979).

 Prior to the Voyager encounters, the only species known with certainty to be present in Titan's atmosphere were CH4 and C2H6, although there was evidence for the presence of C2H2 and C2H4 as well (Gillett 1975). The presence of N2, predicted by Hunten (1977) and Atreya et al. (1978), had not yet been established, although Titan's reddish-brown albedo suggested that nitrogen-bearing species (and/or sulfur-bearing
 ones) should be present in the haze aerosols (Scattergood and Owen 1977; Chang et al. 1979). The Voyagers revealed that Titan's atmosphere consists predominantly (&gt;90%) of molecular nitrogen (Broadfoot et al. 1981; Tyler et al. 1981) with methane as the next most abundant species and provided positive identifications of several hydrocarbons including C2H2, C2H4, and C3H8 as well as of the nitriles HCN, HC3N, and C2N2 (Hanel et al. 1981, 1982; Kunde et al. 1981; Maguire et al. 1981).

 During the interval between the Voyager encounters and the arrival of Cassini in the Saturn system, several photochemical
 models were developed to describe the production of hydrocarbons and nitriles resulting from the dissociation of N2 and CH4 in Titan's upper atmosphere by electron impact (N2) and UV irradiation (CH4) (e.g., Yung et al. 1984; Toublanc et al. 1995; Wilson and Atreya 2004). More a number of laboratory, modeling, and theoretical studies were undertaken to investigate the formation of the haze
 layers and the physical, optical, and chemical properties of the aerosols in light of both the Voyager data and new remote-sensing
 observations (see reviews by Cabane and Chassefière 1995 and McKay et al. 2001). Post-Voyager experiments to synthesize aerosol analogs in the laboratory involved both the production of tholins in a simulated
 Titan N2-CH4 atmosphere (e.g., Thompson et al. 1994; Coll et al. 1999) and the creation of the photopolymers of C2H2, C2H4, and HCN (Bar-Nun et al. 1988; Scattergood et al. 1992) as well as of HC3N and HC3N/C2H2 (Clarke and Ferris 1997). The spectral and optical properties of tholins were found to be consistent with Titan's albedo and with the refractive
 properties of Titan's haze particles, suggesting that tholins are good analogs for Titan's aerosols (Khare et al. 1984).

 The ultimate sources of Titan's aerosols are the gas-phase dissociation products of CH4 and N2. However, as noted by Lebonnois et al. (2002), the transition from gas-phase compounds to solid-phase aerosols is poorly understood. They suggested three possible chemical
 pathways that could polymerize simple molecules to macromolecules, which are the presumed precursors to aerosol particles,
 producing: (1) polymers of acetylene and cyanoacetylene, (2) polycyclic aromatics, and (3) polymers of HCN and other nitriles,
 and polyynes. Their model suggested a total production rate of 4 × 10−14 g cm−2 s−1 and a C/N ratio of 4, in a production zone slightly lower than 200 km altitude. Wilson and Atreya (2003) considered similar pathways and concluded that the growth of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) throughout the lower
 stratosphere could play an important role in haze formation. They suggested that the peak chemical production of haze would
 lie near 220 km, with a column integrated production rate of 3.2 × 10−14 g cm−2 s−1. Wilson and Atreya (2003) pointed out that the discovery of benzene in Titan's atmosphere by ISO (Coustenis et al. 2003) favored the PAH pathway. Trainer et al. (2004) found that for particles produced from a mixture of 10% CH4 in N2 the results were consistent with a large fraction of aromatics, including specific mass spectral peaks likely due to PAHs.
 However, at lower concentrations of CH4 (1% and lower), the mass fraction of PAHs greatly diminished, and an aliphatic pathway dominated.

 Laboratory simulations also indicate a possible key role for PAHs. Khare et al. (2002) reported on an analysis of the time-dependent chemical evolution of gas phase products in a Titan simulation. They found
 an early dominance of aromatic ring structures that led in the later stages of the experiment to the appearance of nitrile
 and amine compounds. Thompson et al. (1991) reported the yields of gaseous hydrocarbons and nitriles produced at pressures (1,700 Pa and 24 Pa) in a continuous-flow,
 low-dose, cold plasma discharge excited in an atmosphere consisting of 10% CH4 and 90% N2 at 295 K. At 1,700 Pa, 59 gaseous species including 27 nitriles were detected while at 24 Pa, 19 species are detected, including
 six nitriles and three other unidentified N-bearing compounds. The types of molecules formed changed even more markedly, with
 high degrees of multiple bonding at 24 Pa prevailing over more H-saturated molecules at 1,700 Pa. Imanaka et al. (2004) conducted a series of experiments from high (2,300 Pa) to low (13 Pa) pressure. They found an increase in the aromatic compounds
 and a decrease in C/N ratio in tholins formed at low pressures, indicating the presence of the nitrogen-containing polycyclic
 aromatic compounds in tholins formed at low pressures. They concluded that the haze layers at various altitudes might have
 different chemical and optical properties, but most importantly they found that there is a fundamental change in the nature
 of haze production between pressures above and below roughly 100 Pa.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract: The temperature and pressure dependence of the rate constant of the methyl-methyl recombination reaction with He bath gas has been studied using time-resolved time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Methyl radicals were produced by the 193 nm laser photolysis of acetone. In the observed temperature (300-700 K) and pressure (0.6-10 Torr) range, the rate constant exhibits a negative temperature dependence and falloff behavior typical for recombination reactions. The integrity of the measurements has been validated by determining the recombination rate constant with Ar (1 Torr) as the bath gas at room temperature and by analyzing the yield of the reaction product, ethane. In addition, rate constants were calculated theoretically using variable reaction coordinate transition state theory in a manner that improves upon the previous treatment of Wagner and Wardlaw by incorporating high-level ab initio results. The calculated high-pressure rate constant can be expressed as (T) = 7.42 × 10-11 (T/298 K)-0.69 e-88K/T cm3 molecule-1 s-1. With reasonable downward energy transfer parameters, the experimentally observed pressure dependence of the rate constants for Ar, He, and H2 bath gases were reproduced very well using master equation analysis. Troe's equation, describing the T and P dependence of the recombination rate constant, was fit to a set of data for He as bath gas comprised of rate constants from this work and taken from the literature. With k(T) set to be the high-pressure limit rate constant calculated here, the other remaining parameters can be given by k0(T) = 1.17 × 10-25 (T/298 K)-3.75 e-494 K/T cm6 molecule-2 s-1 and Fcent(T) = e-T/570K.},

  Abstract                 = {{The Doppler-selected time-of-flight technique was used to study the formation of H and D in the photolysis of CH4 and its isotopomers. The combination of measurements for the photofragment kinetic energy release P(E-T) and the anisotropy parameter P(ET) distributions allows us to differentiate, for the first time, three distinct pathways which are involved in C-H (C-D) bond fission. In conjunction with a recent ab initio theoretical investigation, the mechanisms for this complicated multichannel dissociation process are proposed. In particular, two distinct dissociation pathways are elucidated for the two-fragments channel CH3((X) over tilde (2)A ``)+H. One pathway invokes a perpendicular-type transition in absorption, which subsequently undergoes intersystem crossing to the triplet surface and then dissociates. The fragmentation via this route yields fast CH3 +H with a negative beta parameter. Alternatively, a parallel-type excitation is involved, followed by internal conversion to the ground-state surface on which dissociation occurs. This pathway results in less kinetic energy release and yields a positive beta parameter. An intriguing isotope effect is revealed, which calls for further theoretical investigations.

  Abstract                 = {{In part I of this work the relative velocities and anisotropies of the atomic H and D fragments from methane photolysis at 10.2 eV were measured. In this paper the relative abundance of the methyl and methylene fragments are reported. A complete set of quantum yields for the different photodissociation channels of each isotopomer is obtained by combining the two sets of data. Previously it was found that H atoms are almost four times more likely than D atoms to be ejected; now it is found that hydrogen molecule photofragments are much richer in H atoms than in D. Overall, the heavier D atoms are more likely than the H atoms to remain attached to the carbon atom. An implication for astrophysics is discussed. The VUV absorption spectra of CH4 and CH3D are almost identical both at room temperature and 75 K. There is, as expected, no variation in the absorption spectrum with temperature. Evidence is given that all or almost all of the methylene is produced in the a (1)A(1) and not in the ground B-3(1) state. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics. {[}S0021-9606(00)00934-X].}},

  Abstract                 = {Risk and policy analysis involves consideration of uncertainties. A quantitative probabilistic method for uncertainty analysis includes: (1) quantifying and assigning probabilistic distributions to the input uncertainties, (2) sampling the distributions of these uncertain parameters in an iterative fashion using Monte Carlo methods, (3) propagating the effects of uncertainties through the model, and (4) predicting the outcomes in terms of probabilistic measures like mean, variance, and fractiles. However, the results of the probabilistic analysis depend on the number of samples chosen. The sample size required for a particular analysis depends on various factors such as type of model, the random number generator used, type of distributions, and the output probabilistic measure and cannot be universally defined. The general tendency is to reduce the samples as much as possible without realizing the effect on decisions. For example, the mean of the output requires a number of samples that is an order of magnitude less compared to the variance. Therefore, it is desirable to use a sampling technique that can predict the output probabilistic measure accurately with the minimum number of samples. In this work, we present new sampling techniques based on Quasi-Monte Carlo sequences and Latin hypercube sampling. © 2004 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 23: 141-157, 2004},

The asymptotic form was obtained for the stochastic complexity, or the free energy in the variational Bayesian learning of a mixture of exponential-family distributions, which is the main contribution this paper makes. We reveal that the stochastic complexities become smaller than those of regular statistical models, which implies that the advantages of Bayesian learning are still retained in variational Bayesian learning. Moreover, the derived bounds indicate what influence the hyperparameters have on the learning process, and the accuracy of the variational Bayesian approach as an approximation of true Bayesian learning.},

  Abstract                 = {cf. J. Geophys. Res. 66, 1598-1600; 3033-45(1961). The stability of the ices of H2O, NH3, CO2, and CH4 is important in theories concerning the genesis and evolution of the solar system. In this study lifetimes of small, orbiting ice bodies are considered as a function of their initial sizes, chem. compns., and heliocentric or planetocentric distances. The surface temps. to which this work applies are considerably less than the m. ps. Thus, for small heliocentric distances and for short-period cometary orbits, the surface temp. and hence the rate of mass-loss by evapn. is detd. by balancing the energy received against the energy removed from the surface by ablation, by radiative cooling, and by inward heat flow. The results of the calcn. of surface temps. for the 4 ices as a function of heliocentric distance are given in graphical form. The derived evaporative lifetimes as a function of initial radii show that H2O ice is the most stable, followed in order by NH3, CO2, and CH4. A tabulation of the stability of H2O ice for the various planetary and cometary orbits shows that, over this range, the life of a 1-km. sphere varies from <0.1 for certain cometary orbits to >1015 million yrs. at the Saturn distance. For quite large distances, i.e., >10 times the earth's distance for most ices and possibly 3 times the earth's distance for H2O ice, the Poynting-Robertson effect must also be considered; indeed, it is found that this then becomes decisive in detg. the lifetimes of the several ices. H2O ice is the only one which could be stable on a satellite of Jupiter, NH3 and CO2 could also be stable on a satellite of Saturn (excluding Titan, to which this theory is not applicable), and only H2O and, possibly, NH3, could constitute particles of the size required for Saturn's rings. The stability of H2O ice undergoes a marked change at approx. the distance of the asteroid belt. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  Abstract                 = {Thermodynamic models and experimental data exhibit the usual systematic and random errors. The severity of their errors depends on their use, such as for process calculations in a process simulator. Similarly, the value of better thermodynamic models and/or data should be measured with reference to such use. We have developed techniques for quantification of such thermodynamic-induced process uncertainties via Monte Carlo simulation, regression analyses, and analogies to optimization. The influence of experimental data sources and data types on the uncertainty of thermodynamic models is studied. Details and applications of our new sampling strategy (EPS), which accounts for the high degree of correlation between thermodynamics model parameters, is given. This procedure directly uses the regression results in a way that is much more powerful and mathematically accurate than traditional covariance matrix techniques. Level sets are used for the Monte Carlo samples so that unbiased accurate sampling of the entire feasible region is obtained. Comparison with traditional Monte Carlo sampling, Latin Hypercube sampling (LHS), and Shifted Hammersley sampling (SHS) are shown. The result is an unbiased estimate of uncertainties that reduces the over- and under-estimations common in traditional techniques. The approaches presented can be used for safety-factor/risk analysis, guidelines for simulator use, experimental design, and model comparisons. They allow determinations of the value of obtaining additional phase-equilibrium data and the potential value of improved phase-equilibrium models. Examples and case studies of these applications are provided.},

  Abstract                 = {Dirichlet distributions are natural choices to analyse data described by frequencies or proportions since they are the simplest known distributions for such data apart from the uniform distribution. They are often used whenever proportions are involved, for example, in text-mining, image analysis, biology or as a prior of a multinomial distribution in Bayesian statistics. As the Dirichlet distribution belongs to the exponential family, its parameters can be easily inferred by maximum likelihood. Parameter estimation is usually performed with the Newton-Raphson algorithm after an initialisation step using either the moments or Ronning's methods. However this initialisation can result in parameters that lie outside the admissible region. A simple and very efficient alternative based on a maximum likelihood approximation is presented. The advantages of the presented method compared to two other methods are demonstrated on synthetic data sets as well as for a practical biological problem: the clustering of protein sequences based on their amino acid compositions.},

  Abstract                 = {Following the recent determinations of the fractional abundances of H_3O^+ and H_2O in dense interstellar clouds, the production and loss processes for these species have been investigated in the laboratory. The major processes involved are dissociative electron recombination of H_3O^+ and proton transfer to and from H_2O. The complete product distribution for the H_3O^+ recombination has now been determined and leads to the product channels OH+H_2(0.36), OH+2H(0.29) and O+H+H_2(0.30) with the channel H+H_2O(0.05) being much smaller than previously assumed. It has been shown that loss of H_3O^+ by proton transfer to a series of sulphur-containing species with larger proton affinities is very efficient and also non-dissociative, further establishing the trend for proton transfer reactions involving this ion. These data have been used in a limited model to predict the fractional abundance of H_2O and the relative abundances of H_2O and H_3O^+ in Sgr B2. Predictions are also made for other dense interstellar clouds.},

This paper describes (i) how the output distribution of a Monte Carlo (MC) evaluation of uncertainty can be summarized for use in another analysis and (ii) how a general probability distribution can be summarized for efficient use as an MC input distribution. The principal technique discussed involves fitting an asymmetric form of 'lambda distribution' to the summarizing data. This distribution is defined by the inverse of its distribution function, so the generation of random samples from this distribution is straightforward.The inverse of the distribution function is known as the 'quantile function'. The principle advocated is that of working with distributions with convenient quantile functions instead of distributions with convenient probability density functions. This principle is applicable whether the distributions represent sampling distributions, as in frequentist statistics, or patterns of belief, as in Bayesian statistics.},

  Abstract                 = {The photodissociation of methane at Lyman &#945; (1216 �) has been the focus of much scrutiny over the past few years. Methane photolysis leads to the formation of H2 molecules as well as H, CH, 1CH2, 3CH2, and CH3 radicals, which promote the propagation of hydrocarbon chemistry. However, recent studies [Mordaunt et al., 1993; Romani, 1996; Smith and Raulin, 1999] have not fully resolved the issue of methane photolytic product yields at this wavelength. We use a one-dimensional photochemical model with updated chemistry to investigate the significance of these quantum yield schemes on the hydrocarbon chemistry of Titan's atmosphere, where Lyman &#945; radiation accounts for 75% of methane photolysis longward of 1000 �. Sensitivity studies show that while simple hydrocarbons like C2H2 (acetylene) and C2H4 (ethylene), which serve as important intermediates to the formation of more complex hydrocarbons, show virtually no variation in abundance, minor C3 molecules do show substantial sensitivity to choice of quantum yield scheme. We find that the C3H4 isomers (methylacetylene, aliene) and C3H6 (propylene) display major variation in atmospheric mixing ratios under the implementation of these schemes, with a maximum variation of approximately a factor of 5 in C3H4 abundance and approximately a factor of 4 for C3H6. In these cases our nominal scheme, recommended by Romani [1996], offers an intermediate result in comparison with the other schemes. We also find that choice of pathway for non-Lyman &#945; methane absorption does affect hydrocarbon chemistry in the atmosphere of Titan, but this effect is minimal. A 65% variation in C2H6 (ethane) abundance, a value within observational uncertainty, is the largest divergence found for a wide range of possible non-Lyman &#945; photofragment quantum yields. These results will have significance in future modeling and interpretation of observations of the atmosphere of Titan.},

  Abstract                 = {The early evolution of Titan's atm. is expected to produce enrichment in the heavy isotopomers of CO, 13CO and C18O, relative to 12C16O; however, the original isotopic signatures may be altered by photochem. reactions. This paper explains why there is no isotopic enrichment in C in Titan's atm., despite significant enrichment of heavy H, N, and O isotopes. We show that there is a rapid exchange of C atoms between the CH4 and CO reservoirs, mediated by the reaction 1CH2 + *CO -> 1*CH2 + CO, where *C is 13C. Based on recent lab. measurements, we est. the rate coeff. for this reaction to be 3.2 * 10-12 cm3 s-1 at the temp. appropriate for the upper atm. of Titan. We investigate the isotopic diln. of CO using the Caltech/JPL one-dimensional photochem. model of Titan. Our model suggests that the time const. for isotopic exchange through the above reaction is about 800 Myr, which is significantly shorter than the age of Titan, and therefore any original isotopic enhancement of 13C in CO may have been dild. by the exchange process. In addn., a plausible model for the evolution history of CO on Titan after the initial escape is proposed. [on SciFinder (R)]},

  Abstract                 = {Jupiter has a large magnetosphere that episodically precipitates large amounts of energy into the polar atmosphere, giving rise to intense auroras [Clarke et al., 1996; Grodent et al., 2000]. An important consequence of this energy influx is the production of a dark haze [Pryor and Hord, 1991], the formation mechanism of which was hitherto poorly known. Recent observations of benzene on Jupiter [BÃ©zard et al., 2001; Flasar, 2002] provide new clues for a chemical and aerosol model for the formation of heavy hydrocarbon aerosols. The chemistry begins with the destruction of methane by energetic particles, followed by neutral and ion reactions, ultimately leading to the formation of benzene and other complex hydrocarbons, including multi-ring compounds which subsequently condense. High temperatures and effective eddy mixing engendered by the auroras enhance the formation of heavy hydrocarbons and aerosols. This mechanism may be relevant in the atmospheres of Saturn and extrasolar giant planets, and is an example of how a planetary magnetosphere may influence the chemical composition and climate forcing of the upper atmosphere.},

  Abstract                 = {A comparison of several density functional methods for calculating vibrational frequencies is reported. Methods examined include the local S-VWN (LSDA) functional, the non-local B-LYP and B-VWN functionals and the hybrid B3-LYP and B3-P86 functionals. The split-valence polarized 6-31G* basis set has been used in all methods. The computed frequencies were compared with experimental frequencies for a set of 122 molecules (a total of 1066 frequencies). All density functional theory (DFT) methods perform well for the calculation of vibrational frequencies, with overall root mean square errors (34-48 cm-1) significantly less than that reported for the MP2 theory (61 cm-1). The two hybrid functionals (B3-LYP and B3-P86) are more reliable than the S-VWN, B-LYP and B-VWN functionals. Scaling factors recommended for reproducing experimental fundamentals are 0.9833, 0.9940, 0.9820, 0.9613 and 0.9561, for S-VWN, B-LYP, B-VWN, B3-LYP and B3-P86, respectively. The performance of the various DFT methods on the calculation of zero-point energies is compared with experimental results for 24 molecules. Again, the hybrid functionals represent a significant improvement over the local and non-local density functionals.},

  Abstract                 = {Generalized Dirichlet distribution has a more general covariance structure than Dirichlet distribution. This makes the generalized Dirichlet distribution to be more practical and useful. The concept of complete neutrality will be used to derive the general moment function for the generalized Dirichlet distribution, and then some properties of the generalized Dirichlet distribution will be established. Similar to the Dirichlet distribution, the generalized Dirichlet distribution will be shown to conjugate to multinominal sampling. Two experiments are designed for studying the differences between the Dirichlet and the generalized Dirichlet distributions in Bayesian analysis. A method for generating samples from a generalized Dirichlet in presented. When a prior distribution is either a Dirichlet or a generalized Dirichlet distribution, the way for constructing such a prior is discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a Monte Carlo uncertainty/variability analysis applied to assessment of salmonid embryo survival affected by the deposition of fine sand in the spawning gravel riverbed. For the system being modeled, the uncertainty originates from the lack of perfect knowledge about the spawning habitat, while the variability arises from the natural diversity in the amount of sand deposit. A second-order Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) procedure consisting of multiple realizations of model parameters and full-range iterations of input variable is used to separately propagate the knowledge uncertainty and natural variability of the system. Given that the three parameters of the present model are highly correlated (correlation coefficients >0.8), we use four multivariate methods (Iman-Conover method, standard normal transformation method, normal copula method, and maximum-entropy copula method) to generate correlated model parameters. The scatter plots of the correlated parameters generated with various methods demonstrate different correlation patterns. An important finding of the present uncertainty/variability analyses and risk assessments is that the outcomes resulting from the four correlated scenarios are very similar, regardless of the diverse correlation patterns. The output of the second-order MCS is a collection of cause-effect relations (spaghetti plot) that can facilitate the analyses of survival-rate uncertainty/variability. The favorable habitat conditions are also defined on the basis of the spaghetti plot. It is revealed that significant values of information are associated with the parameter correlations, especially when higher levels of embryo survival are targeted. The results further indicate that the outcomes of the independent (less realistic) scenario substantially differ from those of the correlated ones, indicating that the effect of parameter correlations should be incorporated into the MCS whenever possible. This work provides a useful paradigm for the systematic uncertainty/variability analyses in the context of ecological risk assessments.},

The smallest stable nucleus C2 first grows from vapors, and an atom adsorbs to it, and C2 grows to an unstable C3. This becomes the stable structure with minimum total energy from stretching and bending motions. Both of the activation energies of these motions and the adsorption energies of the atom adsorbed to the clusters have been calculated by the density functional theory. The results have shown that almost all C3 become linear in structure. In the same way, the growth of C4 has been analyzed, and it is shown that the majority of C4 come to the stable trans-bent structure and the minority to the cis-bent and the linear structures.},

  Abstract                 = {To account for differences in exhaust composition that arise with the use of fuels other than conventional gasoline, California regulations apply reactivity adjustment factors (RAFs) to emissions standards for new motor vehicles. The RAFs are based on estimates of the sensitivity of ozone formation to each of the individual organic compounds in the exhaust. In this study, uncertainties have been estimated for the incremental reactivities of individual organic compounds and for RAFs for motor vehicle exhaust, accounting for uncertainties in chemical rate parameters and product yields and for variability in exhaust composition. Uncertainties (1sigma) in incremental reactivities of individual compounds range from about 25 to 75% of mean estimates and are typically about 10% higher than previous estimates obtained by considering independent rate parameters as the only source of uncertainty in the chemical mechanism. The incremental reactivities of relatively rapidly reacting compounds are sensitive to the peroxy radical yields in their primary oxidation reactions. RAF values of 0.87 +- 0.11 (1sigma) and 0.42 +- 0.06, respectively, are calculated for exhaust emissions from a test gasoline with low aromatics and low olefins content, and from an 85% methanol, 15% gasoline blend. The RAF values show little sensitivity to product yield uncertainties.},

  Abstract                 = { The large abundance of NH3 in Titan{'}s upper atmosphere is a consequence of coupled ion and neutral chemistry. The density of NH3 is inferred from the measured abundance of NH4+. NH3 is produced primarily through reaction of NH2 with H2CN{,} a process neglected in previous models. NH2 is produced by several reactions including electron recombination of CH2NH2+. The density of CH2NH2+ is closely linked to the density of CH2NH through proton exchange reactions and recombination. CH2NH is produced by reaction of N(2D) and NH with ambient hydrocarbons. Thus{,} production of NH3 is the result of a chain of reactions involving non-nitrile functional groups and the large density of NH3 implies large densities for these associated molecules. This suggests that amine and imine functional groups may be incorporated as well in other{,} more complex organic molecules. },

  Abstract                 = {The Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS) will make comprehensive three-dimensional mass-resolved measurements of the full variety of plasma phenomena found in Saturn&#146;s magnetosphere. Our fundamental scientific goals are to understand the nature of saturnian plasmas primarily their sources of ionization, and the means by which they are accelerated, transported, and lost. In so doing the CAPS investigation will contribute to understanding Saturn&#146;s magnetosphere and its complex interactions with Titan, the icy satellites and rings, Saturn&#146;s ionosphere and aurora, and the solar wind. Our design approach meets these goals by emphasizing two complementary types of measurements: high-time resolution velocity distributions of electrons and all major ion species; and lower-time resolution, high-mass resolution spectra of all ion species. The CAPS instrument is made up of three sensors: the Electron Spectrometer (ELS), the Ion Beam Spectrometer (IBS), and the Ion Mass Spectrometer (IMS). The ELS measures the velocity distribution of electrons from 0.6 eV to 28,250 keV, a range that permits coverage of thermal electrons found at Titan and near the ring plane as well as more energetic trapped electrons and auroral particles. The IBS measures ion velocity distributions with very high angular and energy resolution from 1 eV to 49,800 keV. It is specially designed to measure sharply defined ion beams expected in the solar wind at 9.5 AU, highly directional rammed ion fluxes encountered in Titan&#146;s ionosphere, and anticipated field-aligned auroral fluxes. The IMS is designed to measure the composition of hot, diffuse magnetospheric plasmas and low-concentration ion species 1 eV to 50,280 eV with an atomic resolution M/<IMG SRC=#/iso-ents/isogrk1/dgr-c.gif# ALT=#Dgr#>M <IMG SRC=#/iso-ents/isotech/sim.gif# ALT=#sim#>70 and, for certain molecules, (such as<I>N</I><SUB>2</SUB><SUP>+</SUP> and CO<SUP>+</SUP>), effective resolution as high as <IMG SRC=#/iso-ents/isotech/sim.gif# ALT=#sim#>2500. The three sensors are mounted on a motor-driven actuator that rotates the entire instrument over approximately one-half of the sky every 3 min.},

  Abstract                 = {Dissociative recombination (DR) is a process in which a positive molecular ion recombines with an electron and subsequently dissociates into neutral fragments. Among the different types of molecular ion-electron reactions DR deserves particular attention due to the important role it plays in low-temperature and low-density plasmas. Despite the apparent simplicity of the DR reaction, its investigation has proven to be a difficult task from both experimental and theoretical perspectives. In order to shed more light upon this process the storage ring technique has been introduced and utilised extensively for the last few decades. This thesis is devoted to experimental studies into the DR reaction at the storage ring CRYRING. The DR reaction has been investigated for the following molecular ions; Na+(D2O), PD2+, O3+, N3+, H2+, D2H+, OPCl+, OPCl2+ and H3O+, with the aim to ascertain rotational state effects, to find patterns in the branching products of similar molecular ions, to investigate isotope effects and to study in detail the dynamics involved in the three-body break-up channel.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract: Many processes in biology and chemistry involve multistep reactions or transitions. The kinetic data associated with these reactions are manifested by superpositions of exponential decays that are often difficult to dissect. Two major challenges have hampered the kinetic analysis of multistep chemical reactions: (1) reliable and unbiased determination of the number of reaction steps, and (2) stable reconstruction of the distribution of kinetic rate constants. Here, we introduce two numerically stable integral transformations to solve these two challenges. The first transformation enables us to deduce the number of rate-limiting steps from kinetic measurements, even when each step has arbitrarily distributed rate constants. The second transformation allows us to reconstruct the distribution of rate constants in the multistep reaction using the phase function approach, without fitting the data. We demonstrate the stability of the two integral transformations by both analytic proofs and numerical tests. These new methods will help provide robust and unbiased kinetic analysis for many complex chemical and biochemical reactions.},

  Abstract                 = {Titan's atmospheric winds, like those on Venus, exhibit superrotation at high altitudes. Titan general circulation models have yielded conflicting results on whether prograde winds in excess of 100 m[thin space]s-1 at the 1 mbar level are possible based on known physical processes that drive wind systems. A comprehensive two-dimensional (2D) model for Titan's stratosphere was constructed to systematically explore the physical mechanisms that produce and maintain stratospheric wind systems. To ensure conservation of angular momentum in the limit of no net exchange of atmospheric angular momentum with the solid satellite and no external sources and sinks, the zonal momentum equation was solved in flux form for total angular momentum. The relationships among thermal wind balance, meridional circulation, and zonal wind were examined with numerical experiments over a range of values for fundamental input parameters, including planetary rotation rate, radius, internal friction due to wave stresses, and net radiative drive. The magnitude of mid-latitude jets is most sensitive to a single parameter, the planetary rotation rate and results from the conversion of planetary angular momentum to relative angular momentum by the meridional circulation, whereas the strength of meridional circulation is mainly determined by the magnitude of the radiative drive. For Titan's slowly rotating atmosphere, the meridional temperature gradient is vanishingly small, even when the radiative drive is enhanced beyond reasonable magnitudes, and can be inferred from zonal winds in gradient/thermal wind balance. In our 2D model large equatorial superrotation in Titan's stratosphere can be only produced through internal drag forcing by eddy momentum fluxes, which redistribute angular momentum within the atmosphere, while still conserving the total angular momentum of the atmosphere with time. We cannot identify any waves, such as gravitational or thermal tides, that are sufficiently capable of generating the required eddy forcing of >50 m[thin space]s-1[thin space]Titan-day-1 to maintain peak prograde winds in excess of 100 m[thin space]s-1 at the 1 mbar level.},

Candidate propellants whose performance, materials compatibility, and ease of acquisition are examd. include carbon dioxide, water, methane, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and argon. Ballistic and winged supersonic configuration are discussed. The use of this method of propulsion potentially offers high payoff to a manned Mars mission, both by sharply reducing the initial mission mass required in low Earth orbit, and by providing Mars explorers with greatly enhanced mobility in traveling about the planet through the use of a vehicle that can refuel itself each time it lands. Using the nuclear landing craft in combination with a hydrogen fueled nuclear thermal interplanetary vehicle and a heavy lift booster, it is possible to achieve a manned Mars mission in one launch. Using such a system in the outer solar system, it is found that a low level aerial reconnaissance of Titan combined with a multiple sample return from nearly every satellite of Saturn can be accomplished in a single launch of a Titan IV or STS.
